                            ","THIS IS WAY OVERDUE!!!I have been coming here since they opened. At least a  couple dozen times.  I never thought of myself as a beer connoisseur. I knew I liked Racer 5 and Bud Light and everything in between.  Well my brother introduced me to this place a couple of years ago.  Introduced me to Miles and Daniel which are not only friendly and fun to talk to but they really know there stuff.  First off the Ale House rotates beers from many local breweries.  You could go a couple times a week and find a different selection on the wall. Like I said I wasn't a beer connoisseur but the knowledge Miles and Daniel have regarding the different brews was like talking to a wine Sommelier. Yes they have wine too but I haven't tried any of their selection.  Anyways I feel like I have a much better understanding of the different brew types now thanks to the crew at Ocean Ale House.Now lets talk about the food.  A duck egg on a burger? Yes please.  Much like the beer menu the food menu rotates as well. Constantly changing.  Miles takes chicken wings, fries, grilled cheese sandwiches etc and finds a way to kick them all up a notch.  Sometimes he will have some new creation that he wants to try out so it may be a one  or two day thing. So be sure to always take a look at what the days options are.  Don't want to miss anything.  If you are a local to the city whats your excuse. get over there.  If you are from out of town and want to try some local beers come here.  They usually have multiple local breweries on tap.  Get a taste of what the bay is all about without going to multiple spots.",8/7/2018,5.0

                            ","Not the bigger beer fan, but ale houses usually have at least a cider on tap. Was already out here in the city so might as well try something new and fun. Ocean Ale House comes from good recommendations on Yelp, so I made the trip out there.It's quite actually easy to miss especially since you can't really tell its an alehouse from the outside and it's just on a busy street. There is a residential street that is the cross street and you can park there for free if you're stopping by (which is what I did). Stopped in I assume during happy hour hours because it was around 330pm, so you would naturally only assume everybody has a happy hour. Large space, great for coworkers to hang out or a nice bar area for you to do work (they have free wifi, just ask for the password). The rotating beers were written on a board on tap, but also printed out on a menu. Friendly staff willing to answer questions that you might have and encouraging to order some eats with your brews. The cider on tap was Mission Trail Cider Lawyers Plums and Monkey (Cider | Other Fruit | Bradley, CA) with a 13.9 ABV. WUUUUUUUUUT? GET OUT OF HERE! 9oz draft was the best 12 dollars that I ever spent It was delicious and they have a great food menu. I was looking at everything people around me ordered and looked delicious and the portions were huge for the price. Luckily, I wasn't so hungry so I just ordered some fries to soak up the alcohol. HUGE wedge fries that had skin and were seasoned and fried so nicely. Definitely a great place to come hang out and try a couple of local brews. Chill place, unexpected especially for the surrounding area. A great find for sure!",8/15/2018,4.0

The food offerings are also solid and are a notch above run-of-the-mill pub fare in that they try to source well in terms of their meats. The burgers, as a result, are a nice bet.When I visited, I made it in well before closing time, but they seemed in a bit of a rush to close. I can't blame the employees for wanting to get home on time, but the overall feeling was that the effective closing time was much earlier than advertised. Something to keep in mind if you're also out late.",8/10/2018,3.0

I've wrestled with writing a critical review for the last six months, because I really want to support this business. I love what Miles and crew are doing to the neighborhood by creating a really great social space and a sense of community. The entertainment is great, the atmosphere fun and familiar, and overall the place has great energy. The beer selection is excellent, and though a touch on the pricey side, I will gladly pay an extra dollar or two to support bringing a cool bar to the neighborhood. Where Ocean Ale House could stand to improve is food execution and pricing. The concept behind the menu is great, but every time I go there the food leaves me feeling disappointed. I've had the burger twice, and both times the patty was overly salted and seasoned. The grilled cheese was too greasy, and the fries are overcooked. Everything on the menu seems to be $2-$3 more than it should be, which wouldn't be a problem if the execution was better. I usually only come only once every couple of months hoping that the food will improve, but so far it hasn't. I'll continue to come there because I really want to support them, but if the food were better I'd be coming there twice a week at least!",6/14/2018,3.0

I love how they support local musicians and create a nice venue for them to play while serving a nice selection of beers and delicious burgers and fries! It's places like this that's making me love this neighborhood more and more and I'm happy to see more good eats open up along Ocean Ave. This places doesn't look like much from the street and it can be easily passed by if you're driving too fast to avoid the Muni and random teens and elderly folks crossing the crosswalks. But once inside you marvel at the HUGE mural on the wall and the catchy tunes from the band du jour. Parking can usually be found within a few blocks along the side streets...or on Ocean if you're lucky. I'm blessed to be able to just walk over here and drink to my heart's content without fear of getting a DUI....because you'll want to sample as many of their delicious (and strong) beers they've got on tap on their constantly changing beer menu.I like getting their burgers with garlic fries. You just can't go wrong. Their burgers are served deconstructed so some assembly is required...which is good for you picky eaters out there. Overall, great addition to the Oceanview area!

                            ","Free live music on a Saturday lured us to Ocean Ale House, unsure what to expect as to quality of food by what's described on the website but trusting that decent beer at least awaited us. Seating is first-come, and much table-sharing is done with late comers standing where they may ready to pounce on vacancies. We scored the undesirable low seats at the register where I wouldn't normally be satisfied sitting, but that worked superbly since getting another beer meant just holding out your glass. We couldn't see the performers very well, but there isn't a bad seat for hearing them. Cuban country music was on the bill, a somewhat amateurish trio I thought but very entertaining and as I said, free.The menu is entirely burgers and sandwiches, with an arugula salad at the bottom. We ordered two Classic Smash Burgers and the salad to eat, a Tenderloin Cotton Candy and a Honk if Your Heffy to drink. The burgers appeared rather simple in this day and age of extravagant gourmet creations, but were tasty. I didn't like the fries, which were thin, burnt and cold. The arugula salad was well executed and good-portioned. The drafts were outstanding, as expected. We also each had a glass of cabernet sauvignon, surprising for not being rot gut (beer bars not surprisingly overlook their wine list sometimes, or at least do not give much thought to them). The graciousness and hospitality of the staff was uniformly excellent. I'd say that the owners of Ocean Ale House have found their exact, true calling in life. I saw everyone clearing glasses and plates, helping hand chairs around, welcoming and chatting with the patrons, and appearing to enjoy it all. It made me feel like a neighbor to everyone else, though I came across town and rarely go out on Ocean Avenue.",5/22/2017,5.0

My mom had their bunless burger. I cheated on my diet and had a few of her fries that are homemade - yum. The menu is reasonably priced. The beer - so good!

Live music no cover charge and the couple of bands I've seen are really good. Lots of local SF residents from Ingleside and neighboring districts like Westwood Park, Sunset, Glen Park, etc. Miles, the owner is really knowledgeable about the beer and food as well as all the breweries in SF. Food is very good for the menu they are going for and is presented well. It's prepared by a chef that really cares and seems to love what he does. The whole staff is great and it's a friendly cool hang out including for families with children. Parking is pretty good, prices are reasonable, and it's a welcome business to the ever changing Ocean Ave that we all love. Highly recommend to locals and visitors alike. This part of the City is often missed by many that don't come over to the South West side of the City.

The customer service is fantastic and my friends and I felt so welcomed as soon as we walked in - we were greeted with smiles and they were so helpful with our orders. They had a great selection of beer. I got a bottle of the Petrus - really great sour. My boyfriend had the New Holland Dragon's Milk and my friend got the Harmonic Marosa Amber on tap. The stout was delicious and smooth and the amber was crisp. We were all satisfied with our beers. We also ordered a side of fries too and they were delicious - very crispy and well seasoned.

Unfortunately, this place was a let down.  The space is nice and the beer list decent, however, it has some major logistical problems. First, theyarbitrarily changed the opening time last minute without notice. Once inside, you can only order a beer by standing in an enormous line run by one person. He works the register taking both food and drink orders, then walks across the way to fill your beers and walks back to work the register to complete your transaction. If you ordered food, you'll get a number to wait at your table. The whole process is slow and tedious and it took over 20 minutes to get a round drinks! Needless to say, there was no desire to get a second round.
