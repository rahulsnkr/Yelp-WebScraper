The only thing that comes close to the incomparable gloriousness of the hot chocolate is their fresh buttermilk biscuits (one is the size of an appetizer plate) and fresh strawberry jam. This was my breakfast this morning. Yup, that's it. I was so full I couldn't have eaten another bite and very, very happy.My husband had corned beef hash with country potatoes, two eggs and sourdough bread. The sourdough bread looks like it's a quarter of a normal loaf but it's actually just one piece cut in half. His meal was spectacular. I mean...I didn't like it but that's because that's not my thing. The sourdough was outstanding though, as I had a bite. Our dear friend had their vanilla custard cream brûlée French toast, bacon and two eggs. The two strips of bacon could have easily been like five normal pieces of bacon anywhere else. The French Toast (two pieces) was enormous! Enough for like four people to eat. I'll say it's quite loud in there with all the people and they have music on which adds to the din but the food...oh, the food! They also have a bar which you can order food at, so that's an option and opens up sooner than the booths. If you're lucky enough to get a table upstairs it's much quieter up there.",,Yes,No,,,Free

She managed to be attentive and talkative (without being annoying). That's rare.3.The setting gave off a nice feel. It's hard to put into words, but the decorations walk the line between ""hipster/trying too hard"" and ""corny."" I liked it.4. They gave us free food on top of what we ordered. I ain't complaining. Leftovers are nice. We ordered one hot cocoa to split between the two of us and they brought out what were essentially the equivalent of two full hot cocoas at any normal restaurant.Cons:1. The wait is real. Depending on when you arrive, you will probably wait for over an hour. It is what it is.2. The food portions are almost excessively large... normally a positive in my eyes, but good lord there was a surplus of food here. And it's not especially healthy, I suppose.

About five bites in, all four of us mused that it was like the portions and flavors were designed for giants in some creepy cautionary tale about gluttony. The words ""diabetic coma"" were muttered as we gave up even pretending to enjoy ourselves and asked for boxes.

Your best bet to seat quickly is to arrive within the first hour of their opening (7a to 8a). This review reflects their breakfast offerings, though lunch is also served and (I'm sure) is equally appealing. WoM is, perhaps, best known for their crème brûlée french toast - and for good reason. I suggest ordering a savory breakfast and one slice of the decadent French toast ala carte. Hash plates, breakfast burritos, and biscuits with gravy are sure bets. Even a ""simple"" breakfast of toast and bacon is taken to foodie heights with homemade jam, thick-cut bacon, and freshly baked bread.The atmosphere and service are warm and inviting, with just the right amount of quirk.

He stated ""sure"" but seemed annoyed.  Our second table was seated,  they had an infant, and once the table was set with menus and silverware they asked if they could sit and the server (female)  said ""no not until I bring out the waters"" which was frustrating but if that is their process fine.  After the first table received their coffee, a chef or manager came to our table to tell us we needed to leave for saying ""fucking shit"" to the server. Without being given an opportunity to understand or explaining what was an obvious mis-hearing of what was said. In retrospect I can understand that in such a loud,  crammed,  space being mis-heard is a likelihood.  The simple fact that I was accused of cursing,  and a birthday brunch of 11 people,  was kicked out due simply because the server did not hear correctly as it is overcrowded,  noisey, and they are certainly stressed. This was unacceptable. We, as a family,  have been in Word of mouth multiple times monthly.  One server even knew my sister in-law and she recognized them welcoming them back. We will not be returning to this establishment.  Such poor treatment due to a misunderstanding is just unprofessional.

Word of Mouth was my Happy Place. Not only is breakfast my favorite meal and category of food, but finding a place as warm and as welcoming as WoM was and having it be within walking distance from the house we bought in March was like the breakfast gods were smiling down on me. Today, we went to Word of Mouth to celebrate my father's 69th birthday. We were a party of 11 and knew we'd have to sit at separate tables and have a long wait (2 hours), but we didn't care. We were getting to eat at WoM and it was worth the wait and separation. When our first table was sat, water glasses were brought to the table. One had things floating in it and another had a dirty glass. Honestly, not a big deal as it's busy and stuff happens. One of our party simply asked, ""Can we get some water without floating bits in it?"" (politely and without further discussion) and the water glasses were replaced. The rest of our party was sat at a table close by a few minutes later. We switched some seats around (the grandkids wanted to sit eith Pop Pop on his birthday), the waitress came by but we weren't ready to order, and then the owner came by and said he had to ask us to leave for swearing at his server. We literally thought he was joking. Our shocked reaction was genuine, so much so that the owner thought he must have gotten the wrong table and went back to talk to his staff. He came back and said no, that we were the table that swore at his staff and said we had to leave. He then told the rest of our party at the 2nd table to leave as well. When we asked for more details, he said we used the f word to two of his staff and that one waitress was even too scared to come back to the table. The only thing I can think of that may have happened is that, given the volume in the restaurant and that we were at the table right off the waiting area (which was full of people chatting), that the wait staff must have misheard ""floating bits"" as ""f**king bits"" or ""f**king shit"". I can understand why they'd be offended, IF that was what was truly said. However, we weren't given the chance to clear up the confusion or even apologize for the misunderstanding. Instead, we were told we had to leave. Understand that we were a family of 11, ranging in age from 6 months to 69 years old: grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, even a great grandchild. This wasn't a rowdy group of troublemakers causing a nuisance or a scene and being asked to leave because of that. We were simply a family at our favorite restaurant celebrating a birthday. The owner stated that he had to believe his staff and act accordingly. For that, I give him credit and admire his loyalty to them. However, this wasn't a situation where two sides were adamantly being defended and he needed to choose which to believe. We were never given the chance to discover what the misunderstanding was, more or less clear it up. And as a result, not only did we miss out on our celebratory breakfast, got kicked out of our favorite restaurant, have that restaurant lose life long patrons, but (and the saddest thing of all) there are two wait staff out there right now who think they were cursed at when they weren't. That would have ruined my day if I were them. However, it could have been cleared up and resolved had we been given the opportunity to have a courteous and respectful discussion about it. So, if those two wait staff are reading this, I am truly sorry you felt you were disrespected and maligned. Please know that we did not and would not have sworn at you or disrespected you in any way. I am so sorry that this misunderstanding happened and that we didn't get the chance to clear it up. I hope that the rest of your day wasn't darkened by the perception of what happened today, but if it was, I hope reading this helped resolve some of that.

Yes, there's always a wait (45 minutes makes you celebrate, an hour is standard) but they genuinely do what they can to make you comfortable during the wait, with a room with comfy benches and magazines and access to their bar and coffee. When they seat you, they always give you a free dish to apologize for the delay. And most important, the wait is there because the owners are the chefs, and they don't want to grow and the expense of quality. And the food is such top quality breakfast food. It's delicious, simple but with options for everyone, and they're always delighted to make substitutions. It's well priced for the massive portions, and the coffee is great.

Not only is this café stellar because it offers such delicious, comfort breakfast fare, but it's local, boasts super cute foodie décor and you can tell here that everything is made with love.I recently brought another friend here for the first time ... on Super Bowl Sunday. We didn't think it would be that crowded, but there were still people waiting. Still, though, I know that things could have been worse (for a Sunday). Around 12:15 p.m., we were told that a wait for two would be about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was definitely less than an hour. In the meantime, we walked around the neighborhood and browsed through the nearby antique shop. It's really cool how they use a system where you can see your place in-line, online and the page refreshes (and tells you when you need to start heading back to the restaurant). While we were waiting, my friend and I also browsed the menu to see what we wanted so we would be all set to order by the time our name was called. Since it was already a little later for lunch, we decided to share one of the entrees but order separate drinks. During my two previous trips to WOM, my friends and I sat in the main dining area. But, on this trip, my one friend and I were escorted upstairs ... I didn't even know there was upstairs seating! It was the absolute cutest. There are two small tables upstairs and that in of itself made the trip worth it. It was almost like my friend and I got our own private dining experience! It was way more peaceful up there and we didn't feel the need to rush (or that people were staring at us while we ate).My friend said that was one of her most memorable dining experiences. Here's what we got:""Hot Chocolate"": I knew the hot chocolate from here was delicious because I ordered it during a previous visit. I already knew I wanted to order that. And, even though I normally don't like whipped cream on anything, I knew that the whipped cream from here is homemade and it just makes the hot chocolate look extra fancy. Sure, enough, my hot chocolate came out with my friend's order of orange juice, and it looked glorious. In addition to marshmallows, the WOM hot chocolate comes with chocolate chips and sprinkles. I enjoyed every single sip of that sugary sweetness.""The Incredible Flying Biscuit"": My friend and I decided to split this. While I normally go for sweeter items for breakfast, like pancakes, I knew this entrée is one of the eatery's signature dishes. I had it before--and it's huge--so I felt better that my friend and I were sharing it. This entrée features buttermilk fried chicken, a fried egg, melted cheddar cheese and bacon on a fresh-baked buttermilk biscuit layered with sausage gravy. It comes with a side of Yukon Gold breakfast potatoes. Even though I ordered this before, with the first bite, it was sheer bliss. The chicken was tender and moist, and the fried exterior was actually sort of light and not overly greasy. It was cooked perfectly to a golden brown. The slice of bacon was super thick and chewy; I had forgotten what meaty bacon tasted like (so many places skimp on the bacon). The melted cheese oozed out in between yolk from the egg, and the Yukon Gold potatoes were light and fluffy. I especially liked how the exterior was slightly crispy. It's so hard to determine what my favorite part of this entrée is because every component is phenomenal. But the fresh biscuit is probably one of the highlights. It's fluffy, buttery, moist and fresh ... like it just came out of the oven. WOM still has one of the best biscuits I've ever tasted. And, when you get some of the biscuit, chicken, cheese, egg yolk and sausage gravy all in one bite ... well, there's absolutely nothing like it. While I don't usually love gravy, I adore this one from WOM. The sausage gravy is thick and not watery, and the dish has a lot of it -- it's best to smother it all over everything.  Because my friend and I said we were splitting the entrée when we ordered, the WOM staff was so kind to actually split the plate for us (evenly) instead of just giving us an extra plate. While our server didn't come around too much, the wait staff was really friendly and great at giving recommendations. Thanks, WOM, for another great experience and a very memorable first-time experience for my friend.",,Yes,No,,,Free

The hot chocolate mix is made in house and topped with tons of whipped cream, chocolate truffles, and sprinkles. The portions of the meals were HUGE- definitely doggy-bag worthy.

Rumor has it, they have the best Eggs Benedict around!BUT, I knew I also had to try the oh-so-famous Cinnamon Roll Pancake. AND of course the Creme Brulee French Toast! I never come down to Salem, so I wanted to be able to experience it all while I could.Only downfall, these dishes can add up. Especially since it was just me, but There was a LOT of food, because the portions are HUGE!So I took some time to decide, because i can never make decisions. I took a LOT of time actually. And they were awesome about it. They tried helping me decide between the pancake or the toast, and left, and came back, and repeated until I finally settled for the pancake.As I waited, guess what happened. Just guess...... A Random Act of Yumness happened, and it came in the form of Creme Brulee French Toast. YUP.Being the foodie I am, I had to wait to eat it so I could take a picture of it all together, but i took a nibble off the back while it was still fresh, gooey, and un-freakin-believable.Finally, my original Eggs Benedict and Cinnamon Roll Pancake came, I took my pictures, and dug in.The Benedict- HOW have i not been eating this my whole life?!?? It was absolute perfection. Not to mention that it came with 3 eggs so you dont have to worry about running out of egg to go with your muffin. I got it with the potatoes, which weren't anything special. No interesting seasonings, but it went great with the hollandaise sauce drIpping off the sides.The pancake. I cant. I just can't even begin to explain what happened in my mouth when I ate this. It was SO. fluffy. and so perfect. The cinnamon swirl that they used had a candy-like chew that was so good to bite into when you were lost in the fluffiness of the cake. And thats what it was. It was more like cake than typical pancake. Although I felt like I died a little inside with the heaping amount of frosting, but now that I had the full effect, I'd definitely ask for it on the side.And finally, the french toast. My fork made a crunch, a mush, and then another crunch. Crunches being the crystallized sugar that was on the outside of the toast, and the mush being the soft gooey creamy inside that is bread. I don't know if they soak the bread in the cream, but it felt like it was no longer bread, and more of a bread pudding. And it was the best thing ever.Who am i kidding.

First things first, the portions here are HUGE so come very hungry, order something that will reheat well, or this is a great opportunity to split a meal with someone and maybe add a side. They also occasionally give out ""random acts of yumminess"" where they will deliver a free item to your table such as a single blueberry or cinnamon roll pancake or a piece of the french toast, I have been lucky to be on the receiving end of this 2 of the 3 times I have visited. They've started using an online/text system for the waiting list so gone are the days of waiting hours in line to be seated, why haven't more brunch places started using this technology! You put your name on the list, they will take your phone number and immediately text you a link to view your live spot in line and they will text you again when you're close and give you twenty minutes to show up. Heck yes, sign up on the list, do an hour of shopping and return to chow down. I've had the CREME BRULEE FRENCH TOAST which was delicious, thick cut slices so one is more than plenty unless you want leftovers (which I can verify reheat well). I appreciate the crunchy sugar coating, the soft fluffy inside and that it is not coyingly sweet IMO. In the past I've had the INCREDIBLE FLYING BISCUIT which was very good, the gravy here is up to par for sure but it is just so huge! I could not come close to finishing it and it's too messy to keep well so it felt a bit wasteful.

We definitely over ordered but we had to try as much as we can. It was all DELICIOUS!

Now usually I would go into details about my food and touch briefly on my husband's food, bit with this review I have to do the opposite. Yes, the French toast I got was good but after a few bites I was overwhelmed with sweet. I'm just not a sweets for breakfast girl, so it wasn't the French toasts fault. I dug into the biscuits and gravy and it was heaven. Big chunks of sausage, pillow soft biscuits. Best ever and I don't love biscuits and gravy. Husband convinced me to try his Ruben and trust me when I say I have never had corned beef and haven't tried sauerkraut since I was 10. AMAZING. They make their own sauerkraut and it was the best thing I'd had in my life. As I type this five days later I'm still thinking of my husbands food. His clam chowder is better than anything one can even get at the coast.We loved WOM so much we ordered ahead this morning for brunch! Husband got the flying biscuit *bacon that is thick and delicious* we got the boys the cinnamon roll pancakes that I tried and were great!

As for the famed creme brulee french toast, it started off okay, but between the caremalized sugar on top and the thick custard in the middle, we both found it to be cloyingly sweet and not worth getting again.

I could feel the enamel on my teeth degrading as I tried to chew it. I've had sand in my mouth, and that was a pleasanter experience. Beneath that dentally challenging crust lurked the most flavorless, characterless, pointless 'french toast' I've ever been served. I can't remember anything else on the plate, but I do remember my partner's plate: he had some kind of hash that seemed to be made primarily of sodium. The 'beef' in the hash might as well have been well-used pencil erasers: same color, flavor and texture that I remember from my childhood in the seventies.WOM's wild popularity has, no doubt, something to do with the fact that there are few alternatives for the kind of people who adore this sort of kitschy, over-decorated, overrated hash joint far beyond the merit it deserves for its terrible food.

This made it very difficult to make my decision since everything looked really interesting. I ended up ordering the Clam Chowder and Amazing Maralago Turkey Burger. First came the Chowder, it was very good. Chowder was silky, had flavors of clam, pieces of bacon, celery, and potatoes. I finished it in no time, probably should've ordered the bowl. Soon came the amazing Maralago Turkey Burger with salad. I first dug into the mixed green salad with basil vinaigrette. The dressing was nice and thick, you can taste basil giving it a wonderful flavor. I dug into the turkey burger shortly. The turkey burger came with house ground turkey patty with lettuce, tomato, red onions, pickles, and mango chutney like sauce with grilled ciabatta bread. all the juiciness from the turkey patty, freshness from the local produce, sweet and addicting sauce of mango chutney, and the bun that's soft on the outside and crunchy on the inside was amazing!

The Hollandaise is very thick and yellow, whereas I prefer mine a little thinner, so this wasn't my favorite version of eggs benedict. However, my friend loved it.-Soup (clam chowder) & salad served w/toasted sourdough bread $7.95- The clam chowder was good but on the thin side. They gave you a generous portion of salad but it was very standard.For three people, this was way too much food and we had leftovers. Note: If you show up late, you will have to wait!

In my experience the rave reviews are somewhat unjustified.We arrived at peak lunch time on a lazy Wednesday afternoon. Though there was a line forming we only had to wait five or so minutes before we were seated at the bar. Keep in mind that getting a car spot in the very limited car park is unlikely. Try around the corner instead (you're allowed on the side streets for 90 minutes, which should be more than enough time).The food itself was a mixed bag experience. We both chose the Signature Bistro Burger. My attached salad, with a mustard based dressing, was without fault. The burger itself was good but very greasy and not the mind blowing fare I was expecting. Honestly, I was more impressed by the Red Robin burger I had in Salem last week.My boyfriend's main irritation was that, despite the fact we were seated at the bar within the vicinity of several waitresses, he was only served one drink (at the very beginning) and was not offered another at all despite the fact that he finished his first before his main even arrived. Furthermore there was a very distinct feel that if you were a regular you were more welcome and generally less deserving of the cursory, somewhat dismissive attention we received.

Seriously. First, yes, there is a bit of wait--and the tiny restaurant was especially popular with families, so as a table of two we did better than the standard 50-60 minute wait, but still likely sat for 40 minutes before getting to deliberate over Word of Mouth's encyclopedia-sized menu. Usually, I'm leery of such large menus--Greek omelets and Huevos Rancheros?!--but Word of Mouth excels at it all because everything is fresh first and foremost. So a toasted breakfast burrito florentine with fresh salsa can manage the bold Mexican flavours against bacon and spinach with a nice green chile salsa specked with fresh cilantro.They are known for their biscuits and sausage gravy, so we had to get one of those. The verdict was it was an exceptional gravy--though not overly peppery, it was packed with big chunks of sausage. The biscuits were buttery and tasty, though as a hobby biscuit-baker, I'm critical of all biscuits and wished Word of Mouth's was a bit flakier. They are also known for a creme brûlée French toast--essentially a traditional French toast topped with a caramelized sugar topping that 'cracks' like brûlée. I went in to this with low hopes--having survived the cinnamon bun French toast era without getting diabetes--and came away really satisfied. The kitchen managed to make a restrained copy of brûlée atop the French toast--and knew better than to even offer syrup; this one doesn't need it.I'm glad the waitress directed us toward the hashes--which again demonstrated Word of Mouth's obsession with fresh. A prime rib hash married large cubes of tender beef with flavourful mushrooms (possibly the star of the hash) and potatoes. Another winner.Portions here are enormous and you could easily share a breakfast entree. In our curiosity to try a diversity of flavours, we ended up with way too much food.

There was loud bleeting ,yelling,profanity, and shouting instead of talking I was empathetic for the staff, but expected them to deal with it. So I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. Management  and staff need to be trained to deal not just give continuous appologies. They need to ask them to leave or call the police and have them removed. I checked the laws and first the staff need a written policy and procedure so it is well defined and staff aren't left in confusion.

My friend had an omelet, potatoes and toast with hollandaise sauce. She mentioned her sauce was really plain and had to add a lot of salt, my CFS had a very gamy taste to it but everything else was wonderful. The only thing that makes this less than 5 stars is that we were told online that they do not take reservations but its very clear that they do. Several people who showed up after we did in the course of 45 minutes were seated almost instantly when they walked in. So either you can grease the palms of the hostess or they take reservations. I will return but I will see if I can call ahead next time- SVJ",,Yes,No,,,Free

Not think they have beer but they offer some killer bloody Mary's... I'll be the first to admit that the Mary's tend to differ a lot from visit to visit but are always good.AMBIENCE:  the ambience is what makes the place for most patrons, it's an old house in a somewhat dumpy area on the cusp of downtown salem.  They have done a good job of making it a cute place.SERVICE:  NO reservations, and a 45 minute wait to be seated is an everyday event here.  the servers here are always friendly, not always super attentive however - for a small place with 3-4 waitresses I'd expect my drinks to be refilled within a few minutes, not at the end of the meal..ALL-IN-ALL:  it's an unusual place/setting for salem, they dont have any competition with the kitschy feel - I think that mixed with consistently good food keeps them really busy - if they were in a strip mall, or there were similar options available I don't think they'd be nearly as popular.",,Yes,No,,,Free

The parking (probably not a lot they can do) has parking for about 8-10 cars and ALL of their neighboring establishments WILL tow your car if you park there, again there is nothing they can do about that.

Here's what was holding me back though; that aforementioned hype...lots of hype means I'm generally obligated to like it, or defend my dislike of it to devotees.  A minor, but oddly real, situation.Two, I dislike crowds quite a bit.  And it's an unmitigated fact that there is almost always a wait to eat at Word of Mouth.But I decided to give it a shot this morning, a little after 8, on a Monday.  I figured it couldn't be too bad then.  Well, there was a wait, actually.  But since I was flying solo, I was offered, and accepted, a place at the bar.  The building itself is an old house, that hasn't been very heavily modified, and I found the interior very warm and inviting. To say I was made to feel welcome would be an understatement.  The young woman working behind the bar, every server, waitress, and other employee that passed by, they were super friendly, very accommodating, and went out of their way to help every customer, not even one in their area, but also (and I find this a uniform trait of any good restaurant) they went out of their way to help each other prep and deliver another server's table.I was having a difficult time deciding what to order.  Word of Mouth tends to try to make good, delicious comfort food with high quality ingredients, and in a manner that is elevated, but not pretentious or unnecessarily fancy.   The most famous piece seems to be the Creme Brulee French Toast, but I am not generally a ""sweets"" person for breakfast.   I know that I don't eat that much, but I just had to go for the Filet Mignon country fried steak.That came with an amazingly huge slab of wonderfully breaded and very tasteful steak, doused with a generous, but not overly large (i.e.: disguising) gravy.  Two scrambled eggs, a large stack of hash browns, and a biscuit that was large enough to act as a cup if it was hollowed out. Before all this, though, I was presented with a plate and a slice of that previously described Creme Brulee french toast.   I had mentioned to my waitress that I had never been to Word of Mouth before, and so she presented me with a complimentary piece of it.  It was hot, filled with an amazingly creamy custard filling, and had a perfect crust of caramelized sugar atop it.   I had one bite and the rest is now in my refrigerator for later consumption, because I knew that if I downed the whole thing, I would not be able to eat breakfast.  It was that good that my ""No sugar breakfast"" thing would have been completely ruined.The main meal was fabulous.  The steak was great, as I said.  The potatoes were a nicely crisped home fries style of potato, with some light seasoning.  The eggs were perfectly done and that biscuit was lovely.  The gravy that I mentioned was not super spicy, it was probably the weakest bit of the whole plate; well, not so much a weakness as the item that stood out the least amongst a plate of stars.My diet coke glass stayed constantly refilled and never got below half empty.  I and the other patrons engaged in banter with almost all the wait staff who came by, and it was just a genuinely welcoming atmosphere.The wait does frighten me from making this a regular spot for me, though.  The waiting area is rather small and features one booth there anyways, where I can imagine people glaring at me if I took a second too long to pay my bill, were I sitting there.  But on off-hours, on weekdays, I will absolutely go back.  There's a whole menu of amazing items I desperately want to try.I am a fan.",,Yes,No,,,Free

The food was simply so good you want to curl up and take a nap afterward -- a bit of a hazard if you're driving to Seattle that morning! I went to law school in the culinary backwater of Salem in the early 1990s and wish that this place had been there then (we went to the Off Center which I see is still in business -- which had its pros and cons .... I'll try them again next time I'm in Salem ... which may be more often now that our friends bought a home and vineyard land in the Eola Hills). A friend and I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs (his poached, mine fried over medium). Shredded and chopped corned beef. Sauteed onions and cabbage (first time I've encountered cabbage in hash -- it added a really nice earthiness). Very tender, moist, and flavorful; not too many potatoes. Eggs were eggs ... I don't really like eggs; they were fine. I had the homemade biscuit (very large) with the second-best Strawberry freezer jam (my deceased nana's was the best -- literally the only item family members good-naturedly jockeyed about after she died ... the remaining 10 jar of jam in her freezer). Fluffy, flaky goodness. Could have been just a touch crisper for my liking, but outstanding nonetheless. My husband had the Creme Brulee French Toast -- aahh was this good. I don't usually like French Toast because after all it's bread soaked in .... eggs .... but the sweetness of the vanilla and caramelized sugar (and the crunchy texture the bruleed sugar added) made this dish over the top good.

The rock sugar on the outside was caramelized (could have used another second or two to get really melty, but whatevs), the inside was moist with cream and soft and good.

It sounded nom.Good: The french toast was as dank as I had been promised. Service was quick.Bad: The sugar on the french toast wasn't quite melted enough. My guess from having made creme brule a time or two is that it needed another few seconds with a slightly less hot flame. They're the pro's, though.Price: $13.00 for two slices of french toast, two eggs, two slices of bacon and a cup of coffee. I was looking to spend a little more in the $10-$11 range.

I found some of the ""charming"" decor to be tacky and poorly placed. I really didn't care for the tee shirts for sale and the WoM coffee mugs. Made it feel touristy. I felt like I was being asked to ""drink the kool-aid"", if you know what I mean. Too crowded, everything pressed in too tight. Employees eating when on duty, in a packed restaurant with customers waiting! One thing I did like though was the friendly casual vibe. Everybody seemed to be having a good time, both employees and guests.SERVICE:I know she was trying, but was it her first day? Stilted, unnatural, forgetful, poorly dressed. It was okay for a bistro I guess, and almost charming in a way, but they really need to step it up a notch. FOOD: Bacon was nice big slabs, but could have been cooked a bit more. Slightly soggy. I know it's hard to please everybody. Scrambled eggs were fine (hard to get that wrong). French toast was almost good, but didn't measure up to the hype. The creme brulee topping was far too brittle, thin, and bland. When chewed, it turned grainy, so the overall effect was almost like eating french toast topped with sand. Nice concept, poor execution. Honestly, if they had just sprinkled some brown sugar on top instead, it probably would have been better. (I'm not saying they should do that, I'm just offering a comparison.)  PRICE/VALUE:Scrambled eggs + bacon + french toast + regular coffee = just over $15. The bacon/eggs were ""bundled"" with the french toast, not ordered as sides. Not a good value, especially considering the low-rent neighborhood and slightly-shabby building.  OVERALL: It feels like they're riding the crest of a hype wave, and certainly raking in the bucks.

This is, hands down, the best place I've ever eaten in Salem. I went with a gluten free friend. So he and self trundled into the bistro about 2:30 on a Friday afternoon. This was an act of genius. Like other people have said, hit it in the 1-3 slot if you want a table, though 2:30 was a little late since we didn't finish until after closing time. But there seemed to be no rush. The waitress was so friendly, I thought for a second she might have been hitting on friend, then realized it was just... being friendly. I spent three minutes totally confused (""What could she WANT?!? What's her MOTIVATION?"") before I realized they might just encourage general friendliness in their staff. Blew my mind. I had the French dip. I asked for lettuce on it, because lettuce rocks. Also, because their lettuce looks like they just ripped it from the fields with their bare hands in the last hour. Fresh in almost magical ways. And I mean, people, it was a French dip. There's not much room for amazement, but the meat was the perfect leanness, fresh bread, fresh lettuce, melted cheese. Life looked good.Gluten free friend had a chicken salad. I must admit, I internally scoffed at him. This place is known for, I kid you not, crème brulee French toast and chicken fried filet mignon, and the guy ordered something that came with carrot slivers on it. But, he's a friend of my youth, so I played along. I have to admit, it did look delicious, as far as entries competing in the salad category go, and she listed about four dressings that made even my mouth water. I was about to ask for one of the vinaigrettes to be drizzled on my sandwich. Salad arrived, everything looked fresh, I heard audible crunch, he all but licked the salad bowl, and life was still looking good. And I noticed other people have mentioned it ... the ladies' room. A full shelf of lotions, hairspray, body spray, etc., like they do in the best places, dropped off by who knows who at one time or another. If you show up 15 minutes early for a date and BYOmakeup, no reason you couldn't get completely ready in there.

We went to this place based upon the reviews & they were right!! This place is a small cottage-like building that is absolutely darling with so much character! Once seated, we loved the atmosphere of dim lighting, a private little table & a mixture of locals & tourists. We had a great server who just made the experience that much better! Now the food.

It was so perfectly prepared that I didn't even need to add syrup or other toppings! I also got a side of biscuits & gravy & was weary of the side dish being nearly $5.....until it came out! An entire plate filled with biscuits layered with the most delicious gravy with chunks of real sausage mixed in! A HUGE portion that had an array of flavors. I also got a side of bacon that was also a little pricey, but they were seriously the biggest,, tastiest pieces of bacon I had ever eaten!

When I moved to Salem, it was one of the first places I was introduced to and for a good 2 months was my absolute favorite lunch spot. They have to-die-for clam chowder and a very, very good turkey burger.First things first though - this place, while insanely popular, is now only open for breakfast and lunch. I have yet to go there when there wasn't a wait. Part of this is because of the great food, but part is due to it being very small. These guys would always post to their facebook page pics of people waiting outside to get in, which would lead you to believe they are doing well. However, they recently decided to stop serving dinner and close at 2? Kind of strange.About the turkey burger - there is a misconception going around that this is Word of Mouth's recipe. The menu states that the turkey burger was claimed to be one of the best by Oprah. Well, it was - but the recipe itself was from a Donald Trump restaurant. I found it a little odd to have another restaurant's food featured on your menu, and it definitely has confused quite a few people. So, i want to like Word of Mouth, but then i think about the limited hours, how busy it always is which makes it almost impossible to eat at in an hour or less (what most working people would have for their lunch break) and the star item on the menu being that burger from trump's place..  Its really the change in hours though that is the killer for me.

Word of Mouth I really wanted to like you. Really, really. More than like, I wanted to love you with a red hot passion. It seemed like it was possible, judging from all of the lovely reviews posted here.But our love wasn't meant to be. I left the restaurant pondering the best route to my car instead of marveling at the meal I'd just eaten. That's a fail, folks. I met some friends for brunch around 11 AM on a Saturday. One of my friends arrived early and put our name on the list. (Word of Mouth doesn't take reservations.) She was given an estimated wait time of twenty minutes but was seated by the time I arrived, around 15 minutes later. Having heard how popular this restaurant can be, I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly we were seated. If you order the creme brulee French toast, like I did, I'd advise you follow Suzanne J.'s advice: order a slice ala carte. Seriously. That's really all you need. I made the mistake of ordering a single slice with two eggs. Those extra eggs were not needed and I ended up wasting them. (Guilt alert.) I had a light snack before driving down to Salem but other than that, the toast kept me full all day. It truly is a decadent treat. So think long and hard before you order extra food. I don't want you to waste money or food.The service was bad. No ""extra-friendly waitresses"" when I was there. Case in point: I never got a refill for my coffee. Not even after I shoved my cup over to the edge of the table in the universal sign of Coffee Addict Here. I'm pretty sure neglecting to refill coffee is the Cardinal Sin of Brunch. Besides taking our orders and dropping off the check, our waitress was absent.If you're gluten intolerant, you should be aware that Word of Mouth doesn't offer any gluten-free options. One of my friends was disappointed to discover this.I was sad to learn that Word of Mouth's hot chocolate is from a mix (meaning: they actually serve hot cocoa). The presentation is beautiful, with whipped cream and chocolate chips, but the beverage is unsatisfying.Needless to say, I won't be making a special trip to Salem to eat at Word of Mouth again.

The drive to Salem was lovely, but this restaurant made Salem worth while.I had never been to Salem before& after eating at so many delicious (&sometimes even cheap) restaurants in Portland, my standards were high. My buddy and I split the turkey burger & their ribs. The turkey burger itself came with a lemony sauce drawn in a heart shape on the patty- a nice touch- and some thickly cut &well seasoned fries. The ribs were smothered with a honey BBQ sauce, and came with a large amount of cod slaw& mash potatoes. So far, so good. I can say that the prices definitely justified the food. Prices: 4 stars.Onto the food itself. The turkey burger was really dry and disappointing. It said on their menu that Opera had tried this very burger and proclaimed it was the best in the world. Maybe they changed the way they made it for her? or maybe she likes her burgers dry? Luckily, the fries that came with the burger were really good. They made up for the burger in fact. Sorry, Word of Mouth, but the turkey burger gets 2 stars.  The ribs tasted much better, but they too weren't the best in the world- a bit dry& the sauce was mediocre.  The mash potatoes however, were excellent. Forget the rib, just get the mash potatoes!!! ribs: 3 stars. The clam chowder that came with the food was excellent, a meal in itself. It almost made me believe I was by SF's fisherman's wharf for a split second.The place itself is lovely. Since it's a converted-house-restaurant, it gives that homey feel.

Highly recommended.2.Prime Rib Benedict: it is pretty yummy too.  It was a large dish but the hash brown was delicious! The egg sauce was typical but the entire ensemble was also creative and tasty overall.3. Clam chowder: it is thick and tasty but I have tired better with a lot more clams than potatoes. However, it was smooth and delicious as well.4. The cheesy BLT is typical looking as other restaurant but my 10 years old son loves it so I tried a bit.  It was not as dry as I thought so it is the improved version of BLT.  I am personally not a fan of BLT myself so this is my observation with this dish.5.

Their creme brulee french toast is really good, but not quite as good as Gravy's (in Portland- Mississippi) custard french toast. I enjoyed their biscuits and gravy, along with many other great items. Cons: I'm not too excited about their space in general and the wait time for a table. First, Word of Mouth has a very small parking area for their guest (I want to say 6 or 8 parking spaces, including handicap). You'd have to park across the street in King's Donut's or Legal Aid's parking lot, and then jay walk over. Second, like most restaurants, their waiting ""lobby"" is right by the entry door. Since the restaurant is extremely small and packed with so many people waiting in their ""lobby,"" it's a challenge to get the entry door to open.

He said it was delicious. We also ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which I think is basically the entree without the sides, and it was amazing! So good, I highly recommend trying it. I also had Oprah's favorite turkey burger which was so good, I will have to figure out the ingredients so I can make it at home.

My husband had the potato soup and he said while it tasted great, the texture was off, too thin with a few chunks of potato that threw it off. He said he would have liked it more if it were all chunky or all pureed and the bacon was not in such big chunks. We didn't have drinks, but the atmosphere was great, the service was great and the food was outstanding. I wish we were around for breakfast because I would have come right back here.

The Salem bistro doesn't disappoint.What has quickly become a Salem hotspot; in less-than-a-year of existence Word of Mouth Bistro has already won a ""Best of Salem"" distinction from the readers of the Statesman Journal.According to co-owner Becky Mucha who shares ownership in the restaurant with her chef husband Steve, the Salem eatery was intended for Eugene. A greedy landlord wanted too high a deposit for a restaurant space downtown, so north to Salem the Mucha's went. Eugene's loss is Salem's fantastic win. There isn't a breakfast spot in the state that could top Word of Mouth. The bistro is also famous for their signature clam chowder, and features a fully stocked bar and local microbrews on tap.The bistro sits in an old house on 17th Street accommodating about 10 tables of patrons spread around three rooms, with four chairs located at the bar.If you're dining alone -- as many regulars do because the food is that good -- or eating out with just one other, sitting at the bar is highly recommended. Located next to the kitchen, the bar provides a frenzy of activity for your enjoyment. You'll quickly find yourself striking up conversations with those seated next to you as well as with Becky -- who in addition to owning the restaurant is a bartender and server -- or any of the other waitress' as they move through the tight workspace. You may also find yourself getting complementary items to go along with your meal; and by the time you're walking out the door you feel as if you've just attended a large family reunion, stuffed from great food and great company.Steve, who spends nearly all his time in the kitchen cooking meals from scratch brings a lot of restaurant experience to Word of Mouth. He owned Salem's Busick Court from 1988 until 1996, while also owning Brick Bar & Broiler (1993-1998) and The Point Downtown (1998-2001), the last falling victim to a poor economy following September 11th.The couple moved to Catalina Island where he managed two resort restaurants. ""In the (offseason), we might have 15 breakfasts, 20 lunches and 5 dinners. So, all winter we'd play with food. We'd experiment, research, explore, we'd perfect. We had fun. That is what we do, that is what we enjoy and that is what you will see at Word of Mouth.""From the scene at the restaurant today, it appears that this weak economy is not impacting patronage. Reasonably priced meals start with the daily breakfast special: usually priced at $3.95 for early birds before 8 a.m., and range to $17.95 for a 12 oz. New York steak seasoned with peppercorn and toped with bleu cheese, mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. Most menu items however fall under the $10 mark. When able, everything that goes into Word of Mouth's recipes is locally grown or produced.Do yourself a favor and hit the road to Word of Mouth Bistro.",,Yes,No,,,Free

But first, about the place itself, the restaurant was set within what felt like a small house, which made it very cozy and warm with the soft lighting, relaxed atmosphere, and lovely waitresses. I ordered the Maralago Turkey Burger with Corned Beef and Cabbage Soup. First of all, a point of clarification: on the menu, they mentioned that this turkey burger was declared to be the best in the world according to Oprah Winfrey. While she declared this about the burger, the staff told me that it wasn't like Oprah traveled to Salem to eat this burger, but instead that they told me that they use the RECIPE that was advertised through Oprah. Nonetheless, it was a very good turkey burger; it may not have lived up to the hype, but that should not diminish how tasty it was. The most notable flavor in the turkey burger was the chutney that topped it, as it really gave it a nice briny range of flavor that I thoroughly enjoyed. The soup was nice and hearty, too, with the corned beef really shining in that dish. Overall, this place was a pretty sweet experience, as the food was notable for very clean flavors.

We selected the hummus plate,  roasted beet and goat cheese salad, and BBQ pork banh mi sandwich along with the Vietnamese iced coffee.

On the side, a cup of Coconut Curried Butternut Squash Soup, which was hands-down fantastic. My parents ordered the Deluxe BLT & Avocado and the Black Forest Ham & Brie, and they loved their selection as well. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. What I appreciated most about him was he would frequently check on us without saying anything, as to not interrupt our conversation but to make sure everything was okay. Fun, classy and lively vibe.

I was ravenous so I also had a cup of the Butternut Curry Soup, an order of the White Truffle Sweet Potato French Fries and a piece of a dark chocolate torte decorates with 4 dots of raspberry oculus. All  of the food was very tasty. My friend had the Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup (Pho) which was as huge as I've ever seen Pho. The fresh toppings, however,  were skimpy and my friend thought the Pho itself was a little too salty. I graciously offered to help with some of the excess Pho and found it just right as to salt. I took one star off for the prices, which I was warned about but I still felt we're high for the portion sizes - on the small-ish side except for the Pho.

On top of it all, I love to cook.  With that being said, you can understand why dining out is a rarity for me.  This makes me a pretty critical patron to impress when I enter a dining establishment.  If I am eating at a restaurant it's either because I am out of town or it's an occasion of some sort.  Recently I had an opportunity to explore a new restaurant because not only was I out of town but it was also my birthday.  I scoured Yelp making sure that I made this decision with care since it is possibly the only child-free dining experience I will have this year.  With much deliberation we decided on the Wild Pear.  Here's what I experienced: Food:   Let's just get right down to it.  The food was wonderful.  I didn't know that it was possible to improve on sweet potato fries, but somehow they managed to.  I tried the vegetable and lentil soup and am now determined to recreate it at home.  It was bursting with basil flavor and so satisfying that I could have made a meal of it.   I followed it up with a generous helping of their chicken salad that was loaded with dried cranberries, hazelnuts and dill.  Chicken salad is a family favorite of ours and will now be adding dill when we make it at home.  The flavor was magical but as I mentioned earlier, I like my food lean so the dressing to chicken ration was a little much for my taste.  My grown daughter was with me and she had pesto pasta that made our taste buds dance with delight.  The portion size was very generous and the flavor was incredibly rich.   The sauce was also perfect for dipping our fresh, soft bread in.  My husband tried the seafood melt and said it was good enough to order again.  That's quite a compliment coming from a commercial fisherman.   Atmosphere: The building was quaint and very charming.  The ceiling was gorgeously detailed atop painted brick walls.  There were bold color pops and tasteful art throughout.  We sat in the center section at a tall bistro table.  We would have preferred a booth but didn't want to wait.  There was additional seating at the bar and they made a good use of space without feeling too cramped.  Although it was very noisy it wasn't so disruptive that we weren't able to carry on a conversation.  We were there on a Saturday close to noon so naturally we expected it to be busy.   Our attire was casual but I wouldn't have felt out of place if I went there dressed up.  It seems like a great place to meet up with girlfriends or to go for an afternoon date.  I wouldn't recommend it for parties larger than five or six unless you don't mind being split up. Service: We received a friendly and warm greeting upon entering and were put on a wait list for seating. We waited outside for about twenty minutes before a table was available.  Even though the place was very busy, our service was prompt and pleasant.  They were properly staffed to accommodate the afternoon crowd and our waitress was efficient and enjoyable.  She was knowledgeable about the menu and committed to offering great service while keeping up at a rapid pace.  It was clear that she was incredibly busy but she never appeared hurried or inconvenienced while serving us.   Menu: The menu was interesting and offered a good variety.  Several of their items featured local ingredients and they had a delicious pear cider on tap.  You could order from a number of soups, salads, individual pizzas, sandwiches, seafood or dinner size entrées.  Many options were gluten free or could be served gluten free.  We struggled to decide because so many choices sounded fabulous.  I noticed there was a kid's menu and a happy hour menu but didn't look closely at either.  You would certainly be able to please a number of different palates with the variety available on their menu. Location: Wild Pear is located downtown Salem within walking distance of shopping and right next to a free parking garage.  I also noticed that a couple people had cycled there and were able to lock their bikes right out front.  We were close enough to be able to peek into a couple shops while we waited for our table.  I would definitely return to the Wild Pear.  The overall experience was pleasant and comfortable and we left very satisfied.  Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert but it looked divine.  It's a great place to meet friends for a casual meal in an inviting atmosphere with above average service.  The building was clean, the food was fresh and the place had a friendly feel about it.  I look forward to exploring more of the menu options on my next vis",,Yes,Yes,Yes,,No

Last time I went here alone I ended up making myself uncomfortable trying to eat both a full appetizer and a main dish all myself.Beyond my own experience, a number of my friends and co-workers eat here on a semi-regular basis, and I've never heard a word of complaint.Now for the downsides. They're minor in my opinion, but you can see I didn't give this place 5 stars, and you should know why.First is that they close at 6:30. It's not terrible, but if you work a bit late or if you need to make arrangements with a babysitter before heading out for a date night then you're not likely to make it here in time. I don't know their reason for this policy, but after being turned away one evening at around 6:40 I automatically relegated this place to the ""lunch-only"" category in my mind. Honestly, for a husband and father with a demanding job, trying to get there in time and rush around looking for parking is going to make the evening more stressful than just eating somewhere else. This is sad because we really do enjoy this place, and if it was open even an hour later it would be a date-night staple.Secondly, as you can see from some of the reviews, the wait staff feel a little inconsistent. I've never actually had a negative experience, and most of my experiences have been great! Still, it does seem that more so than in other places it's up for interpretation whether the staff actually enjoy their job. This doesn't bother me since I don't need my waiter/waitress to have a big fake grin and make inane small talk every time they come to the table, but if that's your ideal, you should be aware that may not be what you get.In the same vein, this place seems to fall into the class of restaurant that has just not quite enough staff. If they had a few less tables the staff would be completely adequate. Conversely, if they had more tables and/or were a more expensive place they would hire more staff and also have things covered. In my mind, this isn't really the fault of Wild Pear in particular, it's just an issue natural to this size and price of restaurant. Again, it doesn't bother me, but it might explain the widely differing reviews you'll see.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,,No

A week ago we made a reservation for a party of 6 because we knew with holidays it might be busy. We booked one of the tables up at the front. We all arrived at about 2:20 for a 2:30 reservation. One of the tables at front was empty, and the other had a party that appeared to be finishing up. The hostess advised that we would have to wait for the party to leave as they did not want to seat us at the empty table since that was also reserved for some Nordstrom employees (a party of three as it turns out).   Additionally, they reminded us that it was not yet 2:30 and our reservation was for then and they wouldn't be seating us early. There was such an attitude about it though. We were trying to be polite and understand what was happening, but it was just rude. We decided to call  Amadeus Restaurant who told us to come over and they'd be happy to seat us immediately. As we were walking out the door, the hostess said our table was ready (it was now about 2:40 pm and the  ""Nordstrom"" table was still empty, and the hostess went and kicked out the party at the other table, letting them know that there was a 2:30 reservation and we were waiting to be seated.  We were compensated with a free appetizer and an apology by the hostess (she had spoken to the owner who apparently wouldn't budge on seating us before our reservation or at the empty table). We all ordered our meals.  Unfortunately, my burger was so overcooked that it was not edible. By the time the server came to check on us, everyone else was done eating. He offered to have another burger made for me to take home but I declined. At this point I was so disappointed with the whole debacle that I wasn't interested. I ended up paying $11.00 for a burger I ate 2 bites of. They gave me a 10% discount. Normally I would have fought to have the charges removed completely but I was just done with the situation and didn't want to put up a fuss in front of the entire group I was with.  I've been to this restaurant many times and have always been satisfied.  Maybe it was a fluke, but everything was completely mishandled, so they've lost me and four other gals who also won't be going back.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,,No

The restaurant did a great job remodeling, it is very chic and laid back and it a nice change from the decor most other Salem restaurants consist of.The food was pretty good, but not amazing. Unlike other restaurants, the menu does not stick to one type of food but rather offered very different dishes like spaghetti and shrimp, hawaiian kahlua pork sandwich, chicken pot pie, and etc as entrees. They also offer soups, salads, pizza, and sandwiches. We ended up ordering the Wild pear pizza, kahlua pork sandwich, steak skewers, and tomato cheddar soup (special). The soup was delicious, as Bryan said ""It was the best tomato soup I have ever had"", and was very creamy/rich but not overbearing. The steak skewers were cooked really well and I thought out of all the dishes we got, they flavored the steak the best and paired it with a refreshing pesto sauce. The Wild pear pizza consisted of chicken, sliced pear, and pecans on top of a pesto sauce and mozzarella cheese. The pizza was cooked perfectly, the cheese was melted to where it would create cheese strings when you tore each piece apart (my favorite part about pizza), and the overall combination of flavors was really satisfying and fresh- not heavy. The kahlua pork sandwich was massive, although the pork itself was a bit dry the slaw added on top helped to counteract it and added extra flavor. Our overall experience at wild pear was positive.

It's truly an awesome place with clean, delicious, well seasoned food.I love bistro-style food. I love sandwiches, soups, etc. However, I don't like settling for the bland, processed taste of Subway sandwiches and soup from a can that many other places offer. I want a delicious sandwich that was created with care and thought. I want soup that I've never tried or even heard of before! I love tastes of curry, fresh herbs added to condiments. Subtle details like that is what sets Wild Pear apart from most other restaurants in Salem.Wild Pear breaks the stereotype that good food has to be expensive and take a long time to prepare; That in order to achieve delicious flavors and unique textures you have to do something extraordinary. It's a great example of fresh, high-quality, ingredients creating familiar yet exciting new flavors...in your mouth. Wild Pear was chosen as Business of the Year by the Salem Area Chamber of Commerce in 2012 as well as winning a Best of Mid-Valley award.Here are my favorite dishes:-Soups:1.) Coconut Curry and Butternut Squash SoupThis is my #1 favorite soup - period. The balance of flavors is impeccable. It's rich without being too heavy. I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't like this soup. It is their number one seller and that does not surprise me whatsoever.2.) Veggie ChowderI really liked this variation of chowder. It's especially great if you like chowder but don't want a heavy soup with potatoes, bacon and meat. It's creamy, well-seasoned and delicious.-Sandwiches:1.) Lobster Seafood MeltThis sandwich is....mmm words cannot describe. Maybe it's because I'm hungry right now, but wow...lobster, fish, crab, veggies (minced super tiny), herbs, crispy bread, tomato and melted cheese on top. This is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. It usually comes with kettle chips but I like mine with mixed fries.2.) Turkey HavartiMy close second favorite sandwich - Turkey Havarti. The thing that takes this sandwich to the next level is their spread. I think it's a mayo/dill/seasoning combo and it's absolutely BOMB! It's even better if you ask for the sandwich toasted. That creates contracting textures in your mouth - juicy turkey, crispy bread, melted cheese, fresh veggies.Dessert:Wild Pear has an ever-changing display of delicious desserts! They have chocolate cakes, cookies, non-chocolate cakes, creme brûlée, many many choices. My favorite is the....Creme Brûlée. Simple vanilla creme brûlée with vanilla bean throughout. It has great consistency and a very delicate flavor. It pairs very well with some black coffee.As I ended all of my middle school speeches - ""in conclusion""...Wild Pear is amazing. From catering (which I've also had and it is DELICIOUS) to their restaurant - they excel in every way. I highly recommend this place for lunch, dessert, etc.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,,No

The focaccia bread was light and flavorful. I loved it.

They were pretty bland and didn't really add much to the meal. One person in our party traded out the chips for fruit salad and commented repeatedly on how good the fruit was.The service was good. My only criticism was how loud it was. We happened to be near a speaker and the music volume was definitely intruding on the conversation.

They also have petits fours which was nice to see. I was too full to have any, but next time I will save room. You don't see petits fours very often these days.Very nice atmosphere, too. Very charming space, and I love the layout with the bar to the side and the pastry case straight ahead of the door. It breaks up what might otherwise be a long, dull room into a variety of intimate areas. The only drawback was the noise level.

I had a couple of links on the side, just to try and get some more variety of flavors.  While they weren't bad, they weren't the brisket either. I choose the bbq beans for my side - really meaty, fresh made (the beans weren't mush at all), great flavor.  The wife had the potato salad - something she found to be ""very good"".  Drinks are self serve, sadly they do not offer a brewed Ice Tea which would have been perfection.  But the brisket was so good, the value so good that I couldn't take off a star for not having the perfect beverage options.  (I would have like to see some self serve onion and pickles on the side as well, in case you're listening).The place is jam packed - I suspect a few families have come together to make a go of this, it doesn't look like your typical suspects behind the counter. Seating is on crowded picnic tables inside or other picnic tables outside when the weather isn't so bad.  If they weren't a full hour away from my house, I would have just got it to go and enjoyed it at home.My goodness this is good - don't miss it.  (and get there early - their closing time is listed as ""when everything is sold"", and I suspect that isn't all that long.  Be prepared to wait a little while to get your food, you won't be disappointed.",,Yes,No,No,Yes,Free

This was worth the drive from the other side of the river, through that lovely West Salem rush hour traffic, and that's saying something. My ribs were perfectly cooked--very tender with perfect pink ring. I wish they'd been a tad more flavorful. The sauce at the table helped. My wife's chopped chicken sandwich was excellent--the onion ring was a nice texture contrast. The kids shared a children's chicken strip meal, which was very generously sized. From what I saw, the menu didn't mention alcoholic beverages. It wasn't until I was ordering that I saw a large ice bucket with beer and cider. It was inconvenient having to dig through the ice to see the selection with a long line behind me. Perhaps a small sign near the register with a list?And yes, as others have noted, the line was long and slow, even at 4:30 on a Friday. I waited about 15 minutes to place my order. On the other hand, our food arrived quite promptly, in spite of the crowd. I was happy to see that most of the menu was still available when I was there.

Everything is wet-smoked way too long and the result is mushy meat. The ribs are like bones with pulled pork wrapped around them -- no 'tooth' at all. They have plastic cutlery and that's all you need to slice thru the rack of ribs. The brisket is also overcooked, which is a pity because it has a lovely smoke ring and the flavor is good. You literally cannot pick up a (generous) slice of brisket without having it fall apart.The hot links are an exception to the 'mushy' problem -- they are also overcooked but the result is a dense, tough sausage. The sides aren't much to brag on. The fries appear to be out of a bag, the Cole slaw is (wait for it...) mushy, even the beans have been all mushed up into a paste. A single BBQ sauce is on the table: heavy on vinegar and otherwise unremarkable.So why 3-stars if I don't like the food?

Especially for Oregon, which is never synonymous with BBQ. The outside of the place is easy to drive by, it needs signage and is in fact occupying what looks like an old community center...please do not let that change your mind. Your taste buds will thank you for walking through the door. Inside it very clean, and welcoming. Order at the counter and find a place at one of the large community style picnic tables. I ordered a two meat combo, chose the pork and brisket and they were both incredible. The pork is wonderfully smokey allthough it doesn't overwhelm. It's about as close to North Carolina pork as I've had outside the state. I wish there was a vinegar sauce to go with the pork but that isn't always a popular flavor outside of that state. The brisket is damn near perfection. Just the right amount of fat cap and the bark is unbelievably delicious. The brisket is thick sliced and melts in your mouth. I had the kicked up corn and bbq beans as sides and they were both full of flavor. The corn finishes off with a bit of spice heat and the beans were nice a sweet with some good chunks of meat mixed in. I also got two wimpy burgers, they were actually really good for $1.50 a piece.

They stop serving when they run out - which is how most of the premier BBQ places have to do it since they don't reheat their meat.

We are visiting the area and felt like we needed some good barbecue in our lives. It took us three passes before we realized where this place is located. The signage isn't that great and it does look like a community center. But one cannot judge a book by its cover, so we went in. The place is warm and inviting, it has a bit of an outdoorsy, industrial vibe with community picnic tables. I wish I could leave different ratings for different things because I'd give high marks on what they did with the interior considering what they have to work with. I should note that the place was also impeccably clean.You approach a large open window to place your order. The menu is hanging from above. We let our empty stomachs get the best of us and ordered way too much food. Be aware - the portions are huge! We got ""The Boss"" - two meats, two sides, a pulled pork platter that comes with two sides and a pulled pork sandwich that comes with one side. Once you place your order, grab a seat at the communal tables and wait for your name to be called, your food is promptly delivered to you. I thought the presentation was good - it's BBQ! It's on a tray covered with parchment (or something of the like) and plopped down for your enjoyment. I thought it kept with the simple vibe. They are focusing on what they do best - BBQ. The drinks are an array of fountain Coke products that you serve yourself. They also have tea, but I can't remark on the brew technique. I'd love some brewed sweet iced tea in the Pacific Northwest, but I don't think that's going to happen for me any time soon. So, the food. I had the sandwich and found it to be really tasty, good barbecue. I asked for it spicy, but that didn't happen. There is only one kind of BBQ sauce on the table. Perhaps there are others, but I didn't see any. The sauce was rather thin for my taste, but I'm from the south and I'm used to thick BBQ sauce - so that's my personal preference. I nibbled the chicken and it, too, was tasty. What dropped the star quality of this BBQ joint were the sides. We order baked beans, French fries, coleslaw and potato salad (we like a variety - don't judge). The only thing that I liked were the fries. The potato salad is hopped up on dill and black olives - no thanks. The coleslaw had pineapple in it. Pineapple? Again, no thanks. The baked beans were bland. This is unfortunate in comparison to the meat - because it's really good. They have other sides, but I didn't see any macaroni and cheese. That doesn't mean they didn't have it, maybe I just didn't see it. The place for busy really quickly, so be forewarned to get there early to get your grub. Overall? I'm glad we went - the BBQ is good, service and atmosphere were great. Those sides, tho. I think they need a revamp.",,Yes,No,No,Yes,Free

If you are new to Korean food, order the dolsot bibimbap - when it comes out, poor some soy sauce into the bowl and let it sizzle for a minute to get the rice on the bottom of the bowl nice and crispy. After a minute or so, stir it up and add a little hot sauce if that's your jam.

I want to like it more, but it just doesn't have the same oomph as Korean food in LA. ____________________Swung through with soondubu in mind because I'm riding out a cold. I'll be honest that I was dreaming a little of restaurants who focus on soondubu in LA, but I was glad to even see it on their menu. Also LOL because this was probably the largest gathering of Asians I've seen here aside from when a group of friends came to visit. Oh! And they take 10% off the final bill as their way of sharing God's love - such a great service, and very aligned with their branding because they also close early on Mondays to serve with a church ministry.FOOD/DRINKS-- Banchan: You get 4 items, but they're not the same for every party (I glanced over at the couple next to me and they had different stuff than what I got). Standard stuff.-- Soondubu with beef: Honestly, a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong - it tasted pretty good and was satisfying on a cold night, but the broth wasn't cleaned (skimmed) and didn't have much gochujang in it because it (1) wasn't spicy at all (I order mild anyway, but the menu said it would be spicy..) and (2) wasn't very red/opaque. The egg was already cracked into it too, which I don't mind but could see as an issue for someone with an allergy. Anywho, still satisfying, just a little lackluster.-- Salmon roll: I'm not really a sushi/raw fish person, but it wasn't great. The fish was room temp and the presentation was lacking. Could've passed on this. BUT I know this isn't a sushi restaurant (although they did have a sizeable list of rolls for not being a sushi restaurant...), and I did appreciate that the waiter let me know it would take a little longer when I ordered.-- Orange for dessert: They bring you half an orange per person that's cut up and it comes with a little umbrella. It's lends a quirky and homey touch to the end of the meal.STAFFFriendly and polite but busy - maybe a little short staffed?SPACE/LOCATIONStreet parking. There's a lot off the side of the building but I don't think much of it is theirs. The wait can be long and there's not much space to stand around to wait. I came in on a Saturday evening right around 6 and the place was packed. If you don't mind that though, they're very quick to clear and clean tables once a party leaves.",,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No

It had maybe 2 ounces. I know I measure my food daily. The sauce was okay it was thin and was very slight in flavor.

When we were seated, we had all picked our food out (quite a task for such a large group!) and still had time to twiddle our thumbs before anyone showed up to take our order. Honestly, the food wasn't amazing, but it was good. I had fried rice with shrimp. There were about 3 shrimp. The rice had not a lot of flavor, and had peas and carrots as a main ingredient. I had to add a lot of soy sauce. I didn't get the opinions of anyone else in my party. The tasters that they put on the table before our food were actually the star of the show!! Flavorful bits! It's a small town, and I'm used to a big city with lots of choices, so perhaps this is a local favorite because other Asian choices are even less tasty. What I do love about this place is that they give back to the community.

The seafood tofu soup was OK as it lacked flavor.  I'm used to more variety of seafood in these types of soups I've had in the past. There was also a lot more onions in the soup than I'm used to.. maybe the other ones I've had just cook down the onions more. In addition, I was looking forward to the egg in the soup, but it was too well done. I've also tried the stone bowl dish to-go, but I realized that was probably not the best idea.  I might as well have ordered just the regular bibim bap, because there is no stone bowl to crisp up the rice for a to-go order.. duh! I will order something else if I take it to-go :)  The flavor of the dish was pretty good, and I'd say it's more flavorful than other bibim baps I've had due to the sweet/spicy sauce that comes with the dish.  It's a pretty healthy dish with a lot of veggies.  If there's a way to substitute white rice for brown, it'd be even healthier!Overall, I am a fan of Bibim Bap House.  The restaurant staff told me that parking is free after 5 PM in the parking lot.  Otherwise, they have parking meters in front of the restaurant; make sure you have some quarters.

We were seated promptly and got our menus. My daughter and I have this thing, we always have to try the spicy pork (Daeji Bulgogi). It took a little bit to get our order taken. The lady behind the counter nodded at us to let us know we were not forgotten. It was pretty busy, so of course we understood. After we ordered, just a few minutes later we got our ban chan (Korean side dishes). Then a few minutes after that we were given a complimentary slice of the scallion pancake. It made us wish we ordered it as our appetizer. It was good, real good...We didn't wait long to get our pan fried mandu, mmmm...yea, it was good too. Real good.Then our Daeji Bulgogi arrived sizzling. It wasn't the best I have had, but it was still quite tasty. Real tasty. My daughter nearly passed out from the deliciousness overload.  The restaurant also gives back to the community, helping feed the homeless, how much better can it get?Friendly service, good food, and social responsibility...you can't go wrong.

The food is delicious. We're not particularly experienced with Korean food, but we are pretty experienced with Americanized versions of ethnic foods. We did not get the sense that the menu was built or adapted to the lowest common denominator of American taste buds.We've tried several different dishes and so far my favorite is the Dol Sot Bibim Bap, which is a fried rice dish with a raw egg on top served in a hot stone or cast iron bowl that's still sizzling. We've tried several other dishes as well, and loved every one of them. Oxtail soup is next on my list.One of the fun things is that a small selection of appetizers and a sliced orange for dessert come complimentary with your meal. The appetizers are fantastic. They always seem to include a small amount of kimchi and a slice of a green onion and potato pancake, with a few other dishes that seem to change periodically. They're small, delicious, and serve to whet your appetite, unlike the appetizers you get so often which are massive and more likely to fill you up before your meal than anything else. Since they're included in the price, it's just an additional little bit of variety that comes with your food and you don't have to worry about picking and paying for an extra appetizer or dessert if you're not looking for something major in those areas.The detractors to this place aren't significant enough to reduce my enjoyment of the place, so did not impact the number of stars I gave. Basically, there's not a good waiting area, and the restaurant is popular, so if you end up being seated near the door, then there might be a few people standing fairly close to you while they wait for a seat open up, which is a bit awkward. Also, the lunch dishes seem to be a selection of the exact same dishes available for dinner, but at a cheaper price.

We took up a booth and ordered bibimbap and a kimchi pancake. Everything was fantastic for sure. It doesn't look fancy at all from the outside; there's a bit of angle-in parking, and so many trees that you might not even see the place when you first look for it. Inside, there's plenty of space, with booths on two walls, a couple tables, and a TV. It's clean, and brightly lit, though definitely inexpensively appointed everywhere. Just the basics, nothing fancy. Perfect. The menu is pretty extensive, with Korean, sushi, and Chinese options on 5 or 6 pages. I can vouch for the bibimbap--the stone bowls were hot, the rice got crispy, and all the other ingredients were fresh. The hot sauce is tasty for sure. The pancake might have been the best part of the meal, with great flaky light caking and tasty kimchi balanced well into the dish. They also brought avocado sushi rolls, complimentary, and half a dozen unlimited banchan, and the refills there were another nice surprise alongside the sushi. These people are so, so nice.

It definitely cannot compare with Korean restaurants in California, but the quality is understandable since it's located in an area with a relatively small Asian population. The decor is really simple, and some of the tables are just foldable plastic tables from Costco. I didn't really mind. I think that because there aren't that many Asians in this area, this restaurant tries to serve Japanese and Chinese food in addition to Korean food. It's usually a red flag when a restaurant serves multiple types of cuisines because often times, the chefs spread themselves too thin and the quality of the food goes down. We sat at a table across from the display that showed the fish, and it did not seem that fresh, and people did not seem to be ordering it, so it probably has been sitting there for awhile. My family ordered the dol sot bibimbap, kalbi, grilled calamari, and sam ge tang. I got the dol sot bibimbap because it's kind of hard to mess up bibimbap, but it was just okay. It was a good portion, but it was a little bland. The meat wasn't marinated, and the vegetables were just steamed, which is fine but a little salt would have made it taste better. Also, some sesame seeds or sesame oil would have enhanced all the flavors in the dish more. I liked how the bottom layer of the rice that was touching the stone pot got crispy and once it cooled down, it contrasted nicely in texture compared to all the other ingredients. We were pretty disappointed in the kalbi; it just tasted weird. There was a layer of glaze on top of the kalbi. I've eaten kalbi at many different restaurants, and the marinade and taste is pretty consistent. It just tasted really different and weird here. The thick glaze was not salty or sweet; it was slightly peppery. Also, the quality of meat was mediocre, and there wasn't much meat on each bone. When the ""grilled"" calamari came, it didn't even looked grilled. It looked like it was just steamed and cut into pieces. We then put it on the hot stone pot that the kalbi came with, and it became a little crispier. The sam ge tang is a whole chicken stuffed with sweet rice, ginger, and garlic. I only had the soup of it, but it was extremely flavorful. You could definitely taste each element of the ingredients, especially the ginger, which helps clear your sinuses. It was a little overpowering, but it probably was the best dish we had. The soup was hot but refreshing. The service is pretty good; all the servers were extremely friendly, and upon being seated, they gave us each a slice of Korean pancake. Their banchan selection isn't as big as restaurants in Los Angeles, but decent. I probably would not spend money to eat here if this restaurant was situated in Los Angeles, but because of the demographics of this area, I think that it's a decent option if you choose the right dishes on the menu.",,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No

I came here with a group, but they decided to go elsewhere. I decided to stay on. The three free banchan they brought me consisted of kimchi, cucumbers, and green beens. The kimchi was the best of the three--sour and spicy, but still something I wouldn't hesitate to give to someone curious about kimchi but lacking in experience. The cucumbers, described as ""spicy,"" were more sweet and tangy than hot, but still pretty good. The green beans were fairly bland, and I'm not sure with what they were seasoned. In addition to a small platter of banchan, I was brought a small scallion pancake on the house. I really appreciate such a gesture toward a stranger who stayed. The pancake was a little softer and eggier than its Cantonese equivalent, but still full of scallion-y goodness and well fried. I ordered the dolsot bibim bap with beef, per the owner's recommendation. It came out quickly, with a beautiful egg yolk sitting atop the pile of rice, vegetables, and meat sizzling in a hot stone bowl. The veggies were nicely marinated, and worked well with the other ingredients. The egg, meanwhile, give it a vital heartiness, though I did wish that there was a white with the yolk to stir in. Per the owner's recommendation, as I attacked the bowl, I made a point to scrape at the crispy rice clusters embedded throughout, which added a nice diversity of textures to the dish. The hot sauce they provided was restrained, but good--someone with little experience with Korean food wouldn't have too hard a time experimenting with it and determining how much to add. The meat was minced, rather than the slices I was expecting. It was fine, though I wished that there was more of it. That said, I certainly didn't lack for food at Bibim Bap House. The rice did a good job at absorbing all the other flavors in the dish, and was cooked just the right amount.At the end of my meal, I was brought half of a small orange, cut into two segments and separated from the peel. Bedecked with a cocktail umbrella, it was decidedly silly, but still a nice touch for the end of a meal.I noticed that they have $5 lunch special deals every day of the week. I was feeling like more than the fried rice featured as the Thursday special, and didn't regret the $8.95 I spent on the dolsot bibim bap, but if you're trying to really stretch your dollar, Bibim Bap House seems like a pretty good idea.

It's a small establishment and didn't seem very busy, which was a huge plus for me because it meant I didn't have to wait long to get my food. So far, I've tried the bibimbap and the jjajang myun. For under $10, you get enough food for dinner and a late night snack. What I miss about being in Korea is the huge spread of side dishes. You won't get that here, but you get a good variety. When I ordered the bibimbap, I got some cabbage kimchi, two pieces of vegetable pancake, braised/glazed potatoes, and pickled radish. The sauce I had with my bibimbap was not quite enough and was more sweet than spicy. If I was actually eating it in the restaurant, I'd have chosen to have the bibimbap in the hot stone bowl because I love the crust you get on the rice and the crackle just adds something to the experience. I keep saying I need to purchase one of those bowls for myself. I'm not sure how well they'll do with an electric stove, though! With my jjajang myun, I was hoping I'd get some yellow pickled radish, but instead, I received two pieces of vegetable pancake, bean sprouts, cucumber kimchi, and cabbage kimchi.As I was waiting to receive my jja jang myun this evening, an employee brought out a complimentary plate of oranges that were decorated with those little paper umbrellas. They weren't for me, but the children seated at the table next to me were pretty excited about it.  While we tend to eat pies, cakes, pastries, and ice cream for dessert here in the U.S., Koreans serve fruit. During my childhood, my aunts would serve tomatoes and we'd dip them in sugar. The restaurant's gesture brought back some fond memories.The owners are Christian and the decor reflects that.

My colleagues and I stumbled upon this gem following a pitch as we were looking for a lunch spot. Immediately upon entry I knew we had chosen well as I surveyed the authentic-looking dishes of patrons filling this little luncheonette-style establishment.The Banchan made a great first impression, especially the kimchi which was fantastic! So much so we asked for more. It's hard to find good kimchi even back in the NYC area, so I was thoroughly impressed and grateful to find it here. The starter of scallion pancakes with kimchi continued the trend. Honestly, these were better than my ex-mother-in-law used to make, and that's a tall order. Perhaps the best I've ever had.My colleague devoured his kimchi jigae which looked and smelled delish! Again, the kimchi is outstanding. The disappointment - relatively speaking - was my main dish of bul gogi. As with almost every Korean restaurant, the authentic flavors of this dish are compromised in favor of a sweetened down, sugary version.

Colleagues traveling to Salem regularly request lunch at the bimbap house.  I usually get the Lunch #9, dol sot bibimbap.  Sometimes I get the Jook (rice soup) or Ramen.  I've had a variety of sushi rolls.  But I haven't had everything on the menu because I keep getting stuck on my favorites!First off, this place is crowded at lunch time, but they will do their best to get you seated. Once seated, several small plates of kimchee are brought to the table, including a scrumptious scallion pancake and sweet buttery homemade pickles.  Usually one of the dishes has a little spice, but nothing is hot.  Then, if you ordered the dol sot (which you should have, and if you didn't, now you know better), a large, heavy, metal bowl on a solid wooden slab will be put in front of you.  The bowl will have rice, veggies, meat, and a raw egg on top and it will be HOT.  Stir the egg into the rice, but don't stir too much because you want the rice to cook a little bit onto the pot.  You'll be dreaming of those half stuck amazing rice grains for days....  Anyway, after a few minutes, the egg will have cooked into the mixture.  Add a little sauce and enjoy!  After the meal, when you're shocked that you ate that whole bowl and can't stop yourself from picking those last few encrusted rice grains, the waiter will bring sweet, juicy orange halves with tiki umbrellas.  It's a lovely cap to a terrific meal.  I have only two complaints:  I don't like the lighting and there is no coffee.  I can deal with both of those things in order to have such a lovely meal!",,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No

I am a spice wimp, but I have a curiosity about Korean food. My first time in, I came with a friend and ordered off the menu. According to the menu, spicy dishes have a red star near them. The description of the dish I ordered didn't have ""spicy"" in it either, so i ordered a short ribs in a beef broth hot pot with rice. What came out was the angriest, reddest bowl of soup I have ever seen. It came in a stone bowl that was sizzling for a long time. I thought; so the broth is red. That doesn't mean it's spicy. I took a bite. it was probably the spiciest thing I have ever eaten in my life. I ended up trading entrees with my dining companion. The second time I came in, i pointed to what i wanted to order and asked the waiter if it was spicy. I think I've found my new system. i ordered the Sol Dot Bibimbap. That's the one with the raw egg on top. It was delicious. As I've been returned to this restaurant, I have enjoyed some kimchi without being a drama queen and even added a few drops of hot sauce to my food. i am inviting my friends to come in and dine here with me to see if they will like it too, and to try some more new dishes.

After all, I am a one-man foodie paparazzi.We received a complementary roll, with cucumber, flakes of tempura batter, and a tasty orange-colored sauce on top. Man, was that delicious. Excellently prepared, with fresh ingredients. Other appetizers -- to enjoy with our bowl of rice -- included kimchi, pickled shredded daikon radish, bean sprouts, and nori.The Soon Doo Boo ($8.95; $7.95 if a lunch special) is a spicy silky tofu stew with choice of beef, seafood, or kimchi. I chose seafood this time. As usual, it's not spicy for me, but holy tofu, it's delicious. It's very temperature-hot, but the panda doesn't mind burning the roof of his mouth. If anything, I would have liked more seafood here.When I initially saw the Chicken Bulgogi at $11.95, I was hoping to get a nice portion. And dang, they came through. Coming out on a still-steaming cast iron skillet, the portion could feed two normal people or one hungry Aaron. Incredibly juicy and flavorful chicken. Seriously, I'd come back just for this and the other three Korean BBQ menu items (beef short ribs, the traditional beef bulgogi, and a spicy pork bulgogi rendition). Maybe I can create a food challenge out of this.... (insert beaming panda look here)We sampled the New York Roll, which has tuna, salmon, and apple. I liked the sushi, but the apple was probably only there just to make the ""New York Roll"" an appropriate name. It could have easily been replaced with something else.After all that, the owner had one more surprise for us. Sure, it's half a segmented orange, with a strawberry slice in the middle. Bit it came with a cool mini umbrella! Yeah! Pandas are easily amused! Plus, the orange slicing was pretty impressive.Needless to say, I'm a big fan of Bibim Bap House.

The owner saw me waiting outside and felt bad as she kindly also packed in some stuff for me. She gave me a hot tea and this egg/vegetable pancake appetizer thing that usually comes complementary to any meals purchased except I didn't order anything so that was very thoughtful. The tea did help keep me warm for sure.Later we ended up coming back after the event where we put away our guns so that we can actually sit inside and eat (and be warm). I've never had BiBim Bap before so I ordered that, and I ordered sushi because I couldn't help myself.  Since it was my first time ordering BiBim Bap the lady kindly offered to mix it up for me, but I decided I'm pretty skilled to do it myself lol. The BiBim Bap was good, but I think I do prefer the sushi haha and I just ordered Cali Rolls.

It came with 3 sides: broccoli, kimchi, and bean sprouts. All were yummy; although, I've never taken to kimchi. The bulgogi was really good and I've had good bulgogi before. My Korean friends made it for me all the time. It was marinated well and I loved the flavor. For the price of $12.95, the amount of food was decent but they could portion out a little more, in my opinion. I had a lot of onions left on my plate which outweighed the meat.

We heard good reviews and wanted to try it for ourselves. The weather has been perfect for soupy noodles, but honestly I grew up eating hot brothy meals so any weather is the perfect time for pho. We ordered the fried pork egg rolls as a starter. There are 3 egg rolls cut in half with a side of dipping sauce. The egg rolls are perfectly fried. The only downside was that we did not really taste any pork. It looked and tasted more like the vegetable one - but it was not a big deal to me or my boyfriend and we enjoyed it anyway. The price is the same so there was no reason to speak up on it either.We shared a large pho #102: rare beef and brisket and the beef chow fun. Growing up, beef chow fun was always a staple in our family meal dinners so I am SO HAPPY that it tasted just like back all the restaurants back in LA. The beef pieces were huge, tender and juicy. The pho broth was awesome! It tasted great and there was plenty of beef in it as well. We ordered the large portion and it was way enough to be split. I wish the broth was a little bit hotter, but I'm a fiend of burn-your-mouth boiling hot broth.We can't wait to come back.

Not your standard rings, more meatier chunks. Ordered the kimchi fried rice with shrimp and chicken which came with nice sized shrimp to my surprise. The rice is flavorful, but I think it needed more kimchi. Also ordered the vermicelli noodles with pork. This dish was actually disappointing. The ratio of veggie to noodle is not there. All I tasted was veggies! They layer it with a lot of cucumbers and lettuce. The meat portion was also on the small side.

I ordered a sweet and sour soup with ""fish,"" which arrived as a mix of squid, shrimp and imitation crab. The squid was tasteless and rubbery; that's not a problem because that's the way squid is. The imitation crab and shrimp were similarly tasteless, and that is a problem. In addition, the shrimp was tough. The broth, tagged on the menu with two red peppers for medium hot, was bland. Similarly, the rice noodles were, as expected, utterly bland. I also received a plate of bean sprouts (which I did not use; too risky), two small pieces of jalapeno and a big sprig of basil. The jalapeno and the basil lent some flavor to the soup, but not much.Lana ordered the pad Thai, which she described as similarly bland. She tried adding various condiments but bland remained her verdict.Thus, the food: two stars, edible but tasteless.The taps were as yet uninstalled, so the beer ""on tap"" appeared only on the menu. Of the three or four bottled beers available, only the Deschutes IPA promised any taste. I don't much care for IPA but Deschutes is the best of them, so that's what I ordered. It might have been fine, had the soup possessed the promised moderate level of heat. Lana drank water.Thus, the drinks: two stars.The servers were eager to please but appeared untrained. The first one was unsure of how the spring rolls were prepared. And only a barbarian drinks beer out of a bottle, but I had to ask for a glass. And the empty bottle should have been removed.Thus, the service: two stars.The restaurant itself was typical low-budget strip mall: clean, modern and industrial, with hard surfaces all around reflecting the sound, no decor worth mentioning, and no ""extras"" such as table cloths.Thus, considering the fact that this is a low-cost restaurant, it gets three stars.The relatively small space was crowded with customers, many of whom had small children in tow. The crowd, the children and the hard surfaces created quite a bit of noise, but Lana and I were able to converse easily enough, so I would describe it as moderate.Thus, again considering the fact that Simply Pho is a low-cost restaurant, the noise level also gets three stars.In sum, two stars. With one or more taps, drinks would be three stars but the sum would remain two stars. Tasteless food is not acceptable.",,Yes,No,Yes,,No

We don't eat meat other than seafood and so we couldn't eat the pho! I called them and they said they would replace it right away. We drove back and they were really apologetic and nice, and didn't even charge the difference between the two dishes. Once we got our food home everything was delicious.

It was so appreciated for them to absolutely KNOW and be confident in their kitchen!We ordered the Pho (shrimp) for me, teriyaki chicken and rice and chow mein for kids. Getting our order was not long of a wait at all and although it made my car smell wonderful, we didn't see the food until we were home and unpacked it to find HUGE portions of fresh ingredients and a presentation that survived travel. It was all perfectly packaged and the Pho had the ingredients separated just perfectly to allow me to customize my bowls.The broth was amazing. I could have just sipped it all with nothing else and have been happy. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. Fresh everything. Best Pho I have ever tasted.My kids thought the other dishes we ordered were just as tasty. I didn't sample them but they said they were great, not a bite was left, and they want to go back again--tonight!Clear winner!Check this place out, for sure! Very reasonable prices, too, especially for the volume and freshness of the ingredients! 28 dollars for a large shrimp Pho, teriyaki and chicken dinner that also had fresh veggies, and a whopping serving of chow mein.

It came with packets of Siracha, hoisin, and soy sauce. Overall really good. The large was enough for 2-3 meals. Pot stickers were also awesome! I have one complaint (hence the -1 star.) An elderly man and his wife stopped in to grab a to-go menu. The elderly man walked back in to ask the wait staff if they would be able to accommodate his wife's shellfish allergy.

My husband and I decided to check out Simply Pho Sunday minutes after they have opened. We were kindly greeted by the waitress and asked to choose a table of our liking and given menus to look over. Nice simple easy to read menu. We were surprised by the variety of cuisines offered, but opted to try the Pho since that's the name of the restaurant. We both ordered the 101 which I believe is their version of the ""Pho Dac Biet"" at traditional Vietnamese restaurants and also ordered the shrimp spring rolls to share. The shrimp spring rolls came out in the timely manner with the traditional peanut sauce for dipping. They were decent sized and nicely rolled. I would give it a 7 out of 10 rating. Next our pho arrived. Being of Vietnamese decent and having recently traveled to Vietnam, I definitely know my pho. The pho is decent, could use a little more salt and could use some more flavor from the typical pho seasonings used to make Pho Broth such as Star anises, ginger, onion ect. However the broth was clean, unlike other Pho I have tried where your mouth is just coated in oil. Brisket was thinly cut as should be and tripe looked very fresh. Would have appreciated more meat, as I literally only had one meatball in the entire bowl. I would give the Pho a 7.5 out of 10. Overall, this is a great addition to Salem and I can see the business doing well. The restaurant was full by the time we left. I also very much appreciated that they offered water from a bottle free of charge during our Salem Water advisory.

The hardest part the worst The worst thing about big mamas is freaking getting in the place the parking is in the back and you have to go through like some little side door to get to the restaurant because the main door is exit only in the front side is the street where there is no parking so if you're not already there getting there and parking in the back and then traveling over the river and through the woods to the front is kind of a pain in the butt ox but I guess that's a building there's nothing the restaurant can really do about it so I guess they still get five stars,,Yes,No,No,Yes,Free

Their home made dips and chips were something we HAD to get every Saturday.  If they weren't at the Market, our weekend wasn't complete.  This summer they informed us that they were opening their own little restaurant in the former location of the Froyo in Broadway Commons.  We waited with heady anticipation until today when they opened their doors to the public for their Grand Opening.  We arrived within minutes of their opening the doors and we were NOT the first ones in line.  We were second, but still, it would have been awesome to be the first customer.  But I digress...being fans of their chips and dips it was great to see them using those same dips as spreads on their sandwiches and wraps.  I had their B.L.A.T (Bacon, Arugula, Avocado, and Tomato) Sandwich.  For a $1.50 extra I added fresh pita chips and a side of the Bacon and Caramelized Onion Dip. My partner opted for the Korean Steak in a wrap.  Both our lunches were delectable.  I spent the first five minutes devouring their newest chips: White Truffle potato chips!They are open 7 days a week opening at 11 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday and close at 3 p.m. on Sundays.The menu will satisfy just about everyone and the prices, well it would be a bargain at twice what they charge!

And then she came and asked me again what kind of soup I had ordered.  Perhaps a little more help during busy times of the day?  It should take a minute or less to dish up a to go soup order.  Someone should be on hand waiting just to do that.  In fact, I should not even have to take a number and wait in the lobby for my to go soup order.  Someone should be dishing it out while I pay.  But to add insult to injury, there was not a SINGLE tortelini in my soup.  Not one!  Not even a trace of one!  I was so sad!  Anyhow, I hate to complain-- the food is quite good, the staff is friendly and I know they are trying hard, and it is excellent to have a little cafe to enjoy in the neighborhood, but there are some things that need to be fine tuned!",,Yes,No,No,Yes,Free

If you don't follow my reviews on Yelp, I'll fill you in. I'm VERY selective with my five star reviews! This place DESERVES IT!!! I can't say anything negative about this place.They have a GREAT selection of games, probably all of the ones that you would ever want to play. At least, play seriously, and play a lot, lol! They have a coin machine, obviously, that works with cash, AND cards!The service is outstanding, the employees are nice, and the food is great! (DEFINITELY check out the fries! I believe that they're just regular fries, but I'm not 100% sure, because I wasn't the one that ordered them, and I wasn't there when they were ordered.)The place looks great on the inside, AND on the outside! (There's bike racks with Pac-Man ghosts on them, as well as an aluminum Mario on the Men's bathroom door! I think that it was Mario. I HOPE that I'm remembering correctly, lol!)The colors from the lights, and everything inside, add to the GREAT vibe that they have got going on inside! They also have TV's that, while I was there, were playing Syfy and Comedy Central, as well as old commercials (and maybe some other stuff. I didn't watch that TV as much as the other two, and I didn't watch much of the TV because I was playing games, lol!) They also have some GREAT posters!My friends all drink, and they said that the drinks that they had were great!I can't recommend this place enough. Depending on how close you are, I'd say make the trek, if you're old enough to get in! But if you're in town, especially if you haven't gone before, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! GO! NOW!Slight self promotion, check out the video on my YouTube channel ""dewlover420"" called ""FORTNITE ARCADE GAME?!?!?!"" It should be the first thing that you see when you click on my page! I'm saying this because I have footage inside, as well as footage of me saying the games that I played!

I spend quite a bit of money here. Due to our recent experience, I will never be returning and I will tell all my co-workers and friends to never frequent this establishment again. First off, we had to get our own menus and practically beg the bartender to serve us. He tried to serve the people next to us that came in after us first. To add insult to injury, once we finally got our food after waiting for an entire hour (for a bowser BLT and tacos) the food was horrible. We eat here regularly so we know what the standard is. The bacon was overly cooked and awful to the point I didn't want to eat it, the fries were all the ends of fries so they were crispy burnt tiny fries. The tacos that my boyfriend had were horrible. We literally get tacos here at LEAST once a week if not more. There was barely any meat on them, the meat that was on them was over cooked, and there was more lettuce than anything else on them. We were starving by now so we are the majority of it anyway and didn't even ask for it to be re made or even for a discount. We only asked that they let the cook know that it wasn't good and we would like an apology, to which the bartender was not receptive at all. He actually told us that he wasn't going to apologize if we were that upset. Mind you, we were being very calm and forgiving about the whole situation. All we got was an excuse of , ""well, we're busy."" Which isn't a valid excuse. I expect the food to be good no matter how busy you are or are not. We wrote a tip of $0 and made a note that said ""we tip well when the service doesn't suck."", at the bottom of our receipt. The bartender followed us outside to our car and told us to never come back again. So now, we will definitely never be back again. Disappointing, because this was one of our favorite spots to frequent up until this evening. The last thing I have to say is that we witnessed Alexis drop a rag on the floor, pick it up, and resume cleaning a table with the dirty rag she had just dropped on the floor. Working the front tonight was William, Chris, Alexis, and Hoss was in the kitchen. Sad to say goodbye but that's a pretty horrible way to be treated when you literally spend $70+ dollars a week (not including tips) to an establishment that clearly doesn't appreciate your business.

The classic arcade style games and the 4 person PAC-man are things that allow 'adults' (we all know it's quotes, don't try to talk yourselves out of it) to reach into themselves and touch their children side. This is an incredible concept but the lack of space can be difficult to get around. The functionality of it as a bar/pub and video game arcade is genius however the amount of space does not do the theme justice. If there was a possibility of finding a larger venue to rent/own/lease, I would recommend the owners of The Coin Jam take up that spot. The dining itself could use more space and become more useful for families who come in before the curfew. I would also love to see some lounging furniture for social times for the 'adult' hours.

We arrived here this evening with our friends for dinner as I've never been here before and wanted to try something new out rather than our standby selections in Salem. They were packed this evening for some type of gaming tournament so seating wasn't difficult to find but wasn't easy either. After a short wait we met our servers and got our menus and drinks. After another short while our server came back and took our order which consisted of a caesar salad, 2 stuffed burgers(1 bleu cheese and the other with cheddar) Korean baby back ribs, and the smothered fries and philly cheesesteak egg rolls for appetizers. The food took a little while so we ventured around and played some games for a bit. They have an excellent selection of games here me being a fan of the street fighter series it was nice to bring back some memories of playing all day back in high school. We played a few games and ended going back and the food was all ready at that point. Not really trying all the food I can't really give you a really great review of everything but I can say the stuffed burger I had wasn't bad at all. The smothered fries were an interesting concept and definitely a gut buster. The philly cheesesteak egg rolls didn't really do anything for me so I can't really say I hated them but didn't really enjoy them either. The korean baby backs looked pretty good but the slaw that goes with it is extremely bland. Overall I think this is a really fun place to be. Not quite sure if I'll come back again for the food but definitely would come back for the gaming. Service overall was ok.

I have been to the ground control in Portland several times. I'd say this one is better. Nice friendly staff. Good decor and vibe inside. Tables are not too crowded and nicely situated so they are not a hindrance to ppl playing games. This is a little in contrast to the ground control that has kind of a cheap decor and crowded machines. The variety of games I thought was great and prices super cheap. Some games went for 25 cents.

Mr Patty Sr looked to be back in the kitchen cooking and Mrs Patty herself was working the front counter/room. The menu had a lot of great options and we eventually settled on the Redneck Benedict (husband ate the whole thing) and Cornmeal Pancakes. Mr Patty was also gracious enough to throw a ""babycake"" in for the little one. Everything was tasty and portions were generous. Coffee served up in novelty mugs that I'd like to think were chosen to match our personalities (Superman and Wonder Woman).Loved all the kitschy chicken decor (it caught my baby's eye too).

I'm a professional dog trainer from Seattle as well, and I work with all manner of dogs including reactive, working, show, and pets. What I'm saying here is: I know the laws, and my dog IS professionally trained. Businesses are allowed to ask 2 questions:1. Is the dog a service animal required because of a disability?2. What work or task has the dog been trained to preform? It is ILLEGAL to deny service beyond those questions. Would they deny service to an ex military person with a service animal? Someone with a diabetic alert dog? Seizure alert dog? My recommendation for the business: Be judicious. Ask what you can ask. And if someone has an out of control dog with behavior atypical of a service dog, you CAN ask them to leave. That IS legal.

I am so sad to leave a one star review for this place, as until after we conveniently paid the check and tipped, it was a pleasant, fine experience. However, my friend and I were treated in such a remarkably rude way that I have to warn anyone with young children away from this place, or anyone who has ever been a child, as I'm fairly confident this place is not great for anyone.We drove down from Portland to go to Word of Mouth, which had a 1.25 hour wait, so we (sadly) decided to eat at this place based on the reviews, and called to see if there was a wait for my friend, myself and our four combined children. There wasn't, so we went over.  It seemed remarkably child friendly, including a kids menu, crayons, and coloring pages - hell, even photos of babies on the walls - so we stayed, ordered our food (which was average, adequate diner food - not great, not terrible), and enjoyed our time. Our kids are both 2.5, and we both have babies 7 months and under. Our kids loved the food. The waitress who took care of us was TOTALLY lovely and sweet to us and our family.After we ate, paid, and tipped generously (we are aware that cleaning up after toddlers, regardless of how much we try to straighten up after them, is extra service) the restaurant was close to empty save for one other family with a child who was in another section, which we didn't see. We sat and drank our coffee, with our kids singing ABC and Twinkle twinkle, admittedly a bit loudly but not doing anything out of the realm of totally normal toddler. Trust me, our kids can melt down - this wasn't that. While we were sitting there, Patty, the owner, a cold-lipped, soulless woman who apparently has never met a toddler, came over without any warning and said ""your kids are too loud. You need to leave. Get out."" My friend and I literally thought she was joking, as until then, there had been no indication of anything other than friendliness. We left, and she (no joke) followed us out to tell us ""our kids are uncontrollable."" I was a nanny, have worked in restaurants, and was a kids yoga teacher. My kid was totally in the ""normal kid"" realm - I am the first to discipline him when he's misbehaving, as politeness and graciousness is paramount to me. Lady, if my kid is ""uncontrollable"" when singing the ABCs, I'm not sure you have any clue what that word means. My friend and I were appalled. The other owner came out and said ""I'm sorry you're so mad. We're just too small a restaurant."" Excuse me? Your restaurant was empty (at noon, never a good sign) and you present yourself as a family friendly restaurant. How dare you present yourself as such if you are so obviously completely unfriendly to families.The saddest part is, my friend and I are both discipline-oriented parents who were simply letting our kids be kids in a (what we thought) was a kind environment, in a basically empty restaurant. We have two babies as well as toddlers, and were initially so grateful to have a safe place to have a cup of coffee in a kid-friendly restaurant, and I was looking forward to writing THAT review. If the owner had politely said, as I (or any human being) would have, ""hi there! We have other patrons here. Can you please get your children to be more quiet?"" We would have certainly complied, or downed our coffee and left without complaint. I completely understand that toddlers can be loud, and unpalatable to other customers. However, to unceremoniously tell us to ""get out"" like we were thieves or were breaking things is definitively unacceptable customer service.We promptly called our large social network in Salem to tell us about our experience. From now on, I'd rather wait three hours to eat at Word of Mouth, an equally small restaurant that has always, always, always been nothing but lovely to our children.",,Yes,No,Yes,,Free

The friendly waitress was very polite and arrived right when we were ready to take our order. I ordered the chicken fried steak and my roommate did a Denver omlette.I did read other reviews regarding the chicken fried steak, and, to my disappointment, they were true. The gravy was minimal so I had to outsource to eggs and other 'wet foods' to lather my steak. Not to say that the chicken fried steak was bad on it's own -- but what's a taco without Tabasco? Well, just a taco. But a boring one. Same deal.Meanwhile, the older gentleman behind me (between ranting at his wife about smokers) was wise enough to order extra gravy with his meal. I suppose if I take that route some time in the future, that would be something that I'd need to do.Eggs were done right. The herb biscuit was delicious. Even the potatoes tasted inspired. That's an odd thing to say, but it's true. When my pal was looking the other way, I was able to steal a bite of his omelette, and too, was very impressed with it as well. I've stolen bites from him plenty of times before, so the adrenaline wasn't high enough for it to impact my judgement of his plate.The prices definitely seemed fair, though it seems that some dishes are definitely better than others.

The one of average-friendliness checked on us enough that it made up for her lack of friendliness. The other woman made small talk with us, which we both appreciate.I had The Standard, which is herbed country red potatoes, two eggs any style and an English muffin or an herb biscuit. The herb biscuit is homemade- I asked. My husband ordered Patty's Special Scramble with spinach, ham, mushrooms, tomatoes and potatoes and toast. I really liked my potatoes- they were light and flavorful, and thankfully not drowning in butter. The biscuit wasn't as herb-y as I would like but I could have easily plowed through the whole thing, but I didn't because it was generously sized and I work hard to maintain a lower weight. I wanted to eat it though- it was yummy. The eggs were perfectly over medium and had a little bit of herbs on them. Overall it was the perfect portion for me and only $6. They had my favorite hot sauce- Cholula.

We were warmly greeted by Patty herself; she was very friendly and helped us choose something yummy for each of us. Hubby got the Turkey, Bacon, and Avocado Wrap. It was huge! And very tasty (he let me have a bite). He could only eat half of it and we brought the rest home. He loved the potato salad that came with it.I ordered the Granola French Toast with raspberry syrup; it came with perfectly prepared eggs over medium. And oh boy, that French toast was fabulous! I couldn't eat the whole thing either, so the rest came home with us.In the middle of the meal, a very nice gentleman brought us (for free!) 3 lovely strawberries, picked just that morning, he said.

The cafe doesn't front Center Street; you have to drive into the parking lot. This is the kind of place that we really like, and we were so glad we stopped there. No waiting, great food, and friendly service. And a very clean restroom, too.",,Yes,No,Yes,,Free

The ambiance is that of a cute little country diner with a more upscale twist. Came in originally wanting to try the Tomatoes Florentine but after Patty informed me that it's a 20 minute meal, I decided to opt for the homemade corn beef  hash with an herb biscuit and side of gravy. I was certainly not disappointed! The gravy was perfectly seasoned, perfect consistency and the corned beef hash was a great balance of potatoes and corned beef but with quite a bit of onions and scallions which I felt added a slight freshness to the meal. The cook greated me through his service window and Patty quickly sat and served me. Everyone was kind, clean and quick. I'd absolutely recommend this cute little diner to friends and family searching for a nice American style breakfast with great service. I also asked if in the future I could call ahead to order the Tomatoes Florentine in advance and was told I could. I'll be back in two weeks to give it a shot!",,Yes,No,Yes,,Free

And finally, I topped it all of with some of the breakfast potatoes (nice and crispy) and a few bites of my friend's entree - the granola-crusted French toast - which was really just a vehicle for the amazzzzzzing apple cider syrup, which was unlike anything my mouth has ever experienced.  Oh, and I took a giant cinnamon roll for the road, which I really appreciated when I finally developed an appetite again that evening :)So yes, the food at Patty's is awesome.  And to top it all of, the place is just really cute.  I loved the homey decor, the friendly owners, and the simple touches - like fun mugs for your coffee that are carefully selected just to make you smile.  It feels really good to support a family-owned small business like this - especially one that sources so many local ingredients, an effort that probably really benefits this agricultural community.  I only wish I lived closer so that I could eat there more often!",,Yes,No,Yes,,Free

My only complaint was the hoagie was too much spungy bread, I'd prefer a dark or marble rye toasted bread personally. The potato salad was amazing. I'm really picky on my potato salad and I loved this. The 3 cheese grilled cheese had blue, parm and cheddar with lots of goodness and a parm crust on the outside.

My highest compliments to Chef Bob and owner Patty.My brother and I visited on the fourth of July and were delighted by the friendly array of folks seated at the counter and the high quality of the food. Charming too-- I was served coffee in a Ninja Turtles mug. The scones were soft and buttery, made with cranberries soaked in orange juice. Yummy!  The sausage was made in house. I had to get an extra patty on the side.Upon recommendation by a regular, Jeremy, I tried the chicken fried steak and was blown away by the symphony of flavor that greeted my taste buds. The gravy is to die for and contains the tasty sausage I mentioned. I'm usually not a huge fan of biscuits but the herbed biscuit was surprisingly enjoyable-- soft and flavorful. The scallions topping the chicken fried steak added to the aesthetic of the dish and complimented the rich flavors of the meat.My brother had the red, white & blue pancake special made from fresh Oregon blueberries from Sunnyview Blue Berry Farm. He seemed pleased with the choice he had made, and found the special syrup (containing a bit of vinegar! who knew?) served with it to be rich and enjoyable. I tried it too. YUMMY.

Patty took us to our table and when we were leaving, the cook (I'm assuming her husband or other owner) was in the window right there asking how the food was. You can tell they really give this restaurant all they've got. .. it's small and quiet. There wasn't a wait at all and our food came out pretty quick. Cons: the food was nothing to write home about.  It was very 'herby' ....almost to the point of being too much.  First I thought maybe it was just my dish,  but I tried my boyfriends and his was the same.  I had the corned beef hash which everyone says is great.  Wasn't impressed. To me it tasted like small chunks of pot roast and potatoes. Its plated nice,  and everything was really fresh on his plate (avacado and fresh pico),  but the herbs were over kill. My only only other complaints was there is only one bathroom. We were sitting right by it so there were people lingering the majority of our meal waiting for the restroom. Also the location,  hard to find even with GPS. It's tucked back in the Noble Plaza where you can't see it from the road. It would definitely be easier to find with some signs or something.

Like Kyle R. said, the waitress exclaimed a number of times over the amount of food we ordered, although it was only two dishes each: pancakes, grilled cheese, rueban, and the special chicken fried sausage (which, I should point out, was listed as being spicy). Being the meat eater, I had the latter two. The rueban was excellent. I LOVE reubans, but I don't always love the greasy bread factor; this sandwich was on a dill hoagie thing so not only did I enjoy the lack of grease, I liked the varied texture. The sausage patty thing was ok. Not very flavorful, and definitely not spicy. The plate consisted of one patty that was standard in size, two eggs, a small plop of roasted potatoes (which were very good), an herbed biscuit (a little over done, but ok dipped in gravy) and gravy. Now, the gravy: normally I don't even bother trying restaurant breakfast gravy because I've never had any that even came close to mine. This stuff was pretty good, so don't be afraid. The worst part of the meal was the grilled cheese, which Kyle R. bullied me into trying repeatedly. I just recently decided I don't like bleu cheese, so after one smell I balked. While I appreciate the restaurant's attempt at 'gourmet', I have to say that bleu is NOT the cheese for a sandwich with no counter-flavors. It's just too strong.

This is the 4th breakfast place we have tried in Salem since moving here and the first one I could actually see myself coming back to on a regular basis.  I got the corned beef hash and my boyfriend got the Redneck Benedict.  He said his food was good, called out the biscuit as really good, but overall not mind blowing.  My hash was quite good- well seasoned, corned beef made in house, egg was cooked over medium as asked.  I appreciated that the portion sizes weren't ridiculously huge- that's a pet peeve of mine (just give me less food and charge me less, please!)  Service was great and FAST.  We got a seat right away and food was out quickly.To compare to other options in town:-Corned beef hash wasn't AS good as Word of Mouth's (which is pretty damn good) but it was still really good, and less expensive and we didn't have to wait 1hr and 45 minutes to get a seat.  Doesn't really matter if a place has good food if you can't actually get in there to eat it.  -Food was better than Sassy Onion's which tries to be overly creative but then doesn't execute very well-Atmosphere is much more enjoyable than Busick Court, where you are crammed in like sardinesAnd for us it's walking distance!  I have a feeling weekend morning walks to Patty's is going to become a new tradition.",,Yes,No,Yes,,Free

But have you ever had one of those crappy gluten free crusts that are brittle and have bland taste? This is it. Horrible pizza crust. No tomato sauce. If it weren't for the seductive powers of bacon, this might be the worst pizza in the state. Texture is lost, chewability, balance, crunch, zing, are all zero. The crust had more in common with white bread than pizza crust. Maybe they just didn't cook it enough. Who knows. Steer clear of their pizza. They're trying to be cute. Just avoid it. Stick with a sandwich instead. The food isn't terrible. It isn't great. I wouldn't drive here for it. As far as beer goes, plenty of beer pubs in town with great selection and better food.

What honestly took my burger and fries to the next level was their house sauce which was this wonderful creamy tarragon that, while not overpowering, really popped everything. It seriously put everything on another level. My burger and fries were cooked well, with plenty of garnishes, and everything was great.So, this was a great experience. I don't live in Salem, but one of my family members who does live there suggested it and I'm very glad we went. Four stars - I'd really like to come back someday.",No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Free

We entered, two out of my party sat down and my husband and I went straight to the bar and were trying to decide what type of drink we would like. Mind you we mentioned this was our first time here and wanted to try some before ordering. She said okay, asked no questions and had no recommendations. Radio silence. So I asked what pale ales are on tap trying to get some direction. She was very informative (sarcasm), but she did provide three testers and thankfully we found a good one from the three as there are 36 on tap. So we ordered, I got my drink right away and we sat down. 5 minutes goes by and my husband doesn't have a drink, I'm not one to go out of our way to bother the server because I mean they may be busy with other things. So at 7 minutes she comes to the table and asks if we would like food. My son orders food and I REORDER my husbands beer. She says she would be back shortly. Okay cool. We look up and she's hanging by the register filtering through a stack of debit receipts and then picks her phone up and begins texting. I walk up to the bar to reorder, but she doesn't look up at me for the whole minute and a half that I awkwardly stand there. I stand for a bit more and my frustrated husband saunters up and states we have ordered his beer twice now and are still waiting. She doesn't even apologize and just pours it and places it onto the bar. I wanted to love this place, but if it takes 20 minutes to get a beer that needs to be ordered 3 times until you get it, I don't think I will be back.

We paid for the private patio seating as we had a birthday celebration with 10 guests, mind you this was a Wednesday evening at 7pm so the place was not too busy at all but we didn't know that due to all of us being first timers to this restaurant. We sat, we ordered, drinks came and then we waited. I mean WAITED. Over an hour after sitting our food finally came out. Everyone's meal looked presentable but as we began a few of us quickly realized it just wasn't THAT great. I ordered a ceasar salad with grilled chicken. The lettuce was old and the dressing was watered down and then to top this dish off was some super dry chicken. Another guest complained of their mahi mahi being tasteless and the breading as soggy.The worst of this visit was our server, Amanda. At the start of our experience she seemed friendly enough and even played a little twirling with my 2 year old daughter but this friendly attitude turned bad fast and I mean BAD. she was shrugging her shoulders and throwing her hands up, I mean not even trying to pass as polite or courteous in any manner. Cursing in the kitchen so loud to where I could hear from the seating area and just an overall lunatic which was completely unprovoked by our party. We didn't even mind when we got zero refills on our drinks from the time we sat down until we were midway through eating and politely asked for more water please! The owner attempted to rectify the situation by comping half of our bill and offering his sincerest apology but from the sounds of it, it looks like we were not the only table that complained of her erratic behavior this evening.

Quality, portion, and presentation are fine dining quality that match the prices spot on. You will go home content.SERVICEOutstanding. The hosts were friendly and on top of things, and our server, Lynn, was fantastic. She was attentive, friendly, cheerful, and kind, and provided excellent customer service. Despite that it looked like she had a bunch of big tables all at once when we arrived. And she went above and beyond to follow through with us by phone when we mistakenly thought we'd left a jacket at the restaurant. Very impressive.AMBIANCEHistoric and rustic. Sophisticated atmosphere. It was a little chilly when we went but maybe it was because of the unpredictable hot/cold Spring we're in (or else bring a light sweater). It's dimly lit to read the menu so be wary for older folks at the table.DRINKNice wine selection overall. But I had hoped to find more interesting local wine options from the Northern Willamette Valley to purchase by the bottle (I was interested in a dry white or pinot noir this night). They have the usual suspects for local wines (Willamette Valley Vineyards, King Estate, and 2 solid smaller wineries). And they have the usual suspects for foreign wines (California, France, Italy). But if there is anything at all to gripe about, it would be in this local wine area.Here's what I would have liked to see:1) Add a few more Northern Willamette Valley wine options. (You have limited options for Cubanismo & Sokol Blosser. But what about Cristom, White Rose, Beaux Freres, Owen Roe, St. Innocent, or something along these lines?)2) Educate your staff on the wines. Our waitress was fantastic, but it didn't seem like any of the servers were particularly knowledgeable on the wines and there's no sommelier on hand to help us decide which bottles to order.

In short, I would give the restaurant 3 stars out of 5, although it could have ben 2.7.  The ambience was great; the food was tasty (although the temperatures were uneven and not ideal); and the service was a big uneven--very attentive at the start and then slow to produce our entrees and non attentive to what was lacking.  I can't say that this was due to a rush of customers--there were only two other tables in use when we left.I do not know that we would recommend your restaurant to others, although the meal was adequate--it was not particularly memorable for an anniversary dinner.  A little more effort on service and hotter food upon arrival at the table would have been welcome.",,Yes,Yes,,,Free

It comes out warm with a side of crackers and bread, a very unique flavor, but it grows on you. It reminds me of Christmas. I like the decor of the restaurant, it's got a romantic feel so great for a special occasion or romantic date. I had a Chardonnay and the Kobe steaks in medium,and my dad got the chicken. Both dishes were excellent. It started getting busy around 6:30, I had reservations for 5:30. It does get loud since its in a small area. It was nice that they gave my dad a dessert on the house. There's ample parking as well. Their menu selection for entrees as well as wine list and drink list is substantial so you're bound to find something that entices you.

With brother and sister in tow I ventured forth through windy roads filled with contentious winds.Design-wise it is SO close to being non typical- but this restaurant fails as so many in the area do - by attempting to mix modernity with an organic vibe. People- embrace the grain!!! Go full on!! No need to mix modern cheap with beautiful organic wood! Pick a period or design point of view. The bar is stunning but I was puzzled at the lovely caramel wood walls mixed with  the deep dark angular wood of the bar. Still nice, still fun but inconsistent and felt like a small town attempt at something cool.The restaurant had similar aesthetic issues. Almost but not quite on the design level- a problem common in the area. A nice enough seating area but needs some organic touches and design direction. Stop mixing the Cost Plus style with the inherent beauty of your bones! Yes, I'm a design snob.The food was epic! Halibut, Risotto, Mac & Cheese- all of it! We had desserts which was ok- not amazing but nice. All in all the best dining experience I've ever had in the Salem area so I'm geeked and will be back!

Cheery pleasant staff started the experienced off on a positive note. The menu was incredible and had something for everyone. For a started, their jalapeño poppers have changed my view on what a popper should qualify as. A whole jalapeño in the most delicate and crispy fried shell with a creamy combination of real cheeses. The creamy aioli dressing was the perfect combo and I found myself eating the whole plate. The Cesar side salad was what you hope all Cesar's would look like, beautiful green leafy romaine already tossed and a lemon infused dressing with Parmesan. For dinner I was intrigued by the combination of cheeses for the Mac N Cheese and opted to add chicken. The chicken had a beautiful crunchy sear on it which added a nice smoky flavor against the creamy cheeses.

Kelly was our server. She was patient with my girls as they are picky & slow to order. Now the food we started with the baked brie with bread & crackers. It was a great starter setting our expectations high. Then I had the fisherman's stew. It was filled with seafood & the broth was so good. My husband had the RC burger w/regular fries (had sweet potato option). He asked for it medium well but said it came out well done but said it was still good. My girls split the seafood Alfredo & even tho they split it there where leftovers.  My kids are 11 and 13 so they can eat. They do charge $5 extra if they have to split it in the back but Kelly said that's only if they have to split more then just the main entree.  So she had them split it in the back for us at no charge.  One of my girls also had a bowl of the soup of the day, which was the cheese and broccoli soup.  She couldn't finish it so we took the leftover home.  We finished with a chocolate ganache cake with vanilla ice cream:P  Enough for all four of us.  Kelly, our server, said the brownie was big enough for 4 too but we went with the cake.The bill came to $75 before tip which is normally a little steep for are normal dinners out but since this restaurant received my highest compliment, the 3 G's (great service, great food and great atmosphere) we were glad to pay it.Looking forward to coming back next time we're in Salem!",,Yes,Yes,,,Free

It's located on South River Road and is housed in the old Wild Pear location. Having never eaten at the location previously, I can't compare the decor. What I can say is this restaurant offers plenty of parking in back of the building and is nicely decorated with great lighting.  There is also a bar tucked in the back of the building and we poked our heads in to take a peak on our way out. The bar is similarly decorated to the rest of the building, if not a little brighter than the normal restaurant seating.The dress code is listed as ""casual"" on Yelp and you can probably get away with that. However, since everything is so nicely decorated, I would probably have felt uncomfortable in anything less than a nice shirt and jeans.Now for the dining experience. We were seated immediately when we walked in and had a nice table in the main dining room. And as I already stated above, the lighting and ambiance were perfect.Typically, my husband and I are pretty unadventurous with trying new places when we don't have a good idea what's on the menu. That said, there is no menu online to speak of yet but we wanted to try them anyway just for the great location. The menu offers a variety of appetizers and entrees that range in price with the most expensive being one of the steak entrees around $28. The menu offers a selection ranging from seafood entrees, chicken, beef, and even some pasta. There is even a delicious sounding mac and cheese dish!We ended up starting with the fried corn patties as an appetizer. Very similar to hush puppies but in patty form and served with one of the tastiest BBQ sauces I've had! It is called an Apricot BBQ sauce and they make it themselves, in house. My husband had the Shrimp Étouffée (similar to a spicy jambalaya) while I stayed simple and tried their Caesar salad with grilled chicken and a side of the Apricot BBQ sauce for my dressing. Sounds strange, I know, but it was wonderful. We were both very satisfied with our meals. Incidentally, for those that partake in the wine, their list looked like it offered a good selection. Ultimately, I gave them 4 stars only because my salad was initially brought out smothered in Caesar dressing. The waiter knew immediately though and brought me a replacement right away.Overall, the food and dining experience at this restaurant are definitely worth it and I can't recommend them enough!",,Yes,Yes,,,Free

This was very nice to see.After placing our order, my wife had the Parmesan Encrusted Halibut and I had the New York Steak-Medium, were were served with a basket of delicious warm bread and were immediately offered a refill upon completion. This arrived just prior to our meal and we barely had time to butter the bread before our wonderfully presented entrees were placed before us.Both items were excellently prepared and presented. Of course we always taste each others items and  this time was no different. My wife had a delicious lemon cream sauce under her Halibut that complimented the entree and she commented that my Steak was prepared exactly as was expected, specifically, not too much blood but prepared just right to have the juices run clear. For dessert we each had something different. I had the Tiramisu and she had the Chocolate/Spiced Cake with cream sauce. Both were very tasty and we would likely order both items again.We aren't much for alcohol so we can't say how this part is at this establishment, but our water did just fine to suit us.We have found a new favorite fine dining location and hope to bring others in for a taste of excellence when the occasion permits.

Purists would note that the quad-fecta of Reuben ingredients is supposed to be Corned Beef, Sauerkraut, Swiss Cheese and Thousand Island dressing, and the entirety is to be served on Rye Bread.  That all said, up and down the west coast I've had a number of Reuben sandwiches and some have had some degree of artistic license involved to somewhat mixed levels of success.  Little Lois' takes some license, in substituting Mayo and Mustard for the Thousand Island, and thus serving what's a bit closer to what's known as a ""West Coast Reuben"".  That said, the combination works marvelously, and while I can't give a tip of the hat to this being the Holy Grail of Reubens, I will give it a substantial nod for being a most excellent sandwich.  Very moist and flavorful corned beef, gooey melting Swiss and the most wonderful fresh rye bread!  Very very good--I'd even go as far as saying it's in the Top-10.Wife N's dip was wonderful.  Beef was nicely moist and flavorful, bread moist and again likely fresh-baked and that Au Jus was fantastic--I'd be VERY surprised if it wasn't made in-house from the drippings.Son N said his sandwich was excellent.  I didn't get a chance to take a bite of his, because, being a Middle-Now-High-Schooler his entire sandwich was consumed in four ape-ish bites.  It looked great to me for all four unconsumed milliseconds.Topped it off with a house-made Peanut Butter Chocolate Bar, which was a little sweeter than we'd anticipated, but was absolutely wonderful in both taste and texture.Pricing wasn't bad at all.  $6.50-$7.50 for most sandwiches, which puts this right in line with the major national sub chain's sandwiches, though these taste MUCH better!Yeah, I can believe the five-stars.  Definitely on the better-end of the sandwich shops I've been to.  Too bad we live 50 miles away or we'd be back a lot more often.",,Yes,,No,Yes,No

I complained to the waitress who was actually standing at our table when I pulled it out of my mouth, she went off to grab the cook without saying anything.  The cook comes to the table and sees the cockroach. -""Sometimes they come in on the lettuce, it happens"".- Is what he said to me. I was two seconds from vomiting on the table.  This was a few days ago and I still can't get the crunch feeling out of my mouth.  I have a hard time eating anything these days really.

After reading other reviews, we were looking forward to checking out this little hole in the wall.

When we went in, we were asked to take a seat wherever we'd like and the waitress brought us menus along with a bowl of chips, salsa and beans. The chips tasted very stale and the beans were super runny. I was ready to leave at this point, but again, my husband insisted we give it a chance. Sooooo, I ordered the two cheese enchilada combo and my husband ordered a pastor burrito.  The enchiladas were so doused in sauce and the cheese was definitely a generic (not quality) brand, it was like enchilada sauce soup. The rice was nearly burnt and the beans were again, very runny. Hubby's burrito was mediocre at best, but better than the enchiladas. The interior of the restaurant was also bothersome. It did not feel clean and there was crap piled up all over the place. I wish I could give a more favorable review, but in my opinion, this was truly an awful experience for us.",,Yes,No,Yes,,No

I have definitely found places that measure up, but I have found so many more that have done nothing but disappoint. I didn't expect much of anything in Salem, but the reviews were quite promising, so I decided to take the family to check it out.La Fondita is the definition of a ""hole in the wall"", with minimal seating and basic décor. This, however, tends to bode well for Mexican restaurants, so I was quite excited going in. The menu has quite a few options, and after some deliberation the 2 adult entrees ordered were the Camaraones a la Diabla and the Carne Asada. The ""Diablo Shrimp"" came with several large shrimp prepared in a spicy sauce with onions and mushrooms and was served with rice and beans. The Carne Asada consisted of sliced skirt steak accompanied by lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, jalapeno, rice and beans, lime, and sliced avocado. We also got flour tortillas with them, which are made in house! Each entrée was very well done. The shrimp was quite spicy but with a terrific flavor, and the pairing of mushrooms and onions was perfect. The carne asada was prepared perfectly and was quite tender and flavorful. The beans and rice were also exceptional, which was nice considering they tend to be fairly pedestrian at many Mexican restaurants.There wasn't a kids menu, but there were plenty of inexpensive items that sufficed. The quesadilla from the appetizer menu was served on a house made flour tortilla and filled with cheese and your choice of meat. It came with 2 very large quesadilla triangles which worked perfectly for 2 of my girls to split.  My son wanted something heartier and ordered the Tacos Dorados, consisting of 4 rolled tacos fried to crispy perfection and stuffed with either chicken or beef (he chose beef) and topped with lettuce, sour cream, fresh cheese, tomato, and sliced avocado, and served with rice and beans. It was a hefty plate and quite delicious too.La Fondita very much has a homey, family atmosphere, and we felt very welcomed. The service was very good and quite friendly, and the food was super high quality, great portion sized, and utterly delicious. The prices were also quite good and felt like you really got a lot for your spend. My entire family was very happy with the entire experience. I can imagine seating could get hairy for a large group during busier times (e.g. the weekend), but if you are looking for good, home cooked, authentic Mexican food,  you owe it to yourself to head on over to La Fondita.",,Yes,No,Yes,,No

By the time we left, not a table was empty.First to arrive at the table were our chips, salsa and refried beans. Then our plates of food came, piled high with our orders. The chicken mole was fiery hot. Too spicy for me, but my other half loved it. I thoroughly enjoyed my carne asada. The beef was well seasoned with lots of flavour. On TVs around the restaurant, Frozen in Spanish played and in the background Spanish conversations were shared. Yes, this is as homey as it gets for a restaurant.

I ordered the horchata before I looked at the menu, and the server was so kind that she offered to make my refill the tamarindo at no additional charge.Got the grilled chicken mole oaxaqueno burrito-the depth of flavor was incredible, not tailored for a dumbed-down gringo palate, but with bitter, sweet, earthy, and mildly spicy notes (Flawless 10/10).There is no A/C--only fans, it's swelteringly hot in high summer, the interior gives the impression of being slightly dingy and worn, there are two televisions playing soccer on the wall, and my mother and I were the only white people there--in other words, it was perfect and exactly what I needed to lift my spirits and make me feel at home.  If that doesn't sound like a little slice of heaven to you, there's a Taco Bell down the street.",,Yes,No,Yes,,No

Although its in the view of traffic, the traffic may have a hard time viewing it. It, is nestled closely next to a Mexican market and has such little visibility from the road, I was surprised when google maps led me into this much overlooked corner.The food here is great. The first time I came here I ordered Crispy Tacos, which were basically Taquitos made with real effort. My first thought that came to mind while eating here was balance. The food was not overly saturated with cheese or sour cream, but rather had a healthy balance of beans, rice, cabbage, avocados, etc. One the few meals I've had that was filling, energizing and surprisingly did not lead to bloating and the infamous food coma.Second time, I ordered Enchiladas Verdes which I was also satisfied with. The enchiladas were not drenched in sauce but used conservatively.Service - Its pretty evident this location is family owned and the waiter I had the first time was not so coincidentally the same waiter I had the second go round.

The menu consists of typical mexican food, the prices were awesome - we each ordered two different types of burritos (carne asada, al pastor) - the server brought us chips and salsa which is awesome because I was not expecting that... But unfortunately the chips were stale... Salsa and pico were good...   Our burritos arrive - they look amazing - presentation is awesome - they were absolutely delicious as well.  The server was really sweet/bubbly - but a bit to chatty for my taste...  Overall good experience.Second time I return I brought my gf because she had read a review about the mole... She loves mole dishes.. We get there and sit at a table - they bring out the menus... They're completely different menus from just a week ago, the prices have changed drastically... (Not in a good way$$$) That's ok.. We're hungry and my gf' is super excited about the mole. We go ahead and order - my gf proceeds to order the mole chicken dish...  The server tells us they don't have that anymore... I'm really confused - I ask if they're out or they don't serve that anymore - she tells us they don't serve it anymore... Maybe she was confused.. My gf was bummed, so was I.. Oh well she orders a chicken burrito and I order fish tacos... Again they bring us chips and salsa... And guess what? Chips were even more stale then the first time I came in last... This is getting old guys... C'mon.  So the food finally arrives and my gf enjoys her burrito, I however did not enjoy my fish tacos - they were covered in a weird salsa which wasn't very tasty... The portion was weak - I was expecting something different...   Anyhow this place is just ok - like any other mexican restaurant in salem...  I recommend the burritos only... Although they were a bit too overpriced the second time around... Went from 5.50 to 7.50...  And it really is just a burrito... No sides.  In conclusion I thought I was maybe going to come across something unique about this place but it ended up being a clique mexican restaurant in the end...    Ps please don't serve me stale chips if I decide to come back....",,Yes,No,Yes,,No

The food is excellent, fresh and very tasty. This past time was one of the few times that I did not enjoy their excellent mole oaxaqueño but the owners promised to have it back on the menu very soon. Instead, I had their enchiladas de mole verde which were still mighty tasty but lacked the oomph and spiciness of the mole oaxaqueño. The cóctel de camarón (Mexican shrimp cocktail) is the best I've had anywhere in the Willamette Valley including from any restaurants that supposedly specialize in Mexican seafood cuisine. For lighter fare, they serve a very excellent and large salad that can be topped with freshly grilled chicken  And for dessert, do not leave this restaurant without trying their homemade flan. As for my warning to not bring your Mexican mother/mother-in-law here, not to be racist because I myself am Mexican American but anyone familiar with the culture may realize that the food here is so good that it rivals the best homemade Mexican food. Mexican mothers take great pride in their cooking and may sometimes get jealous if they find out their children prefer another mother's cooking. I'm only thankful that my own mother hasn't figured out how to view these yelp reviews, otherwise, she would scold me for going to La Fondita. Yes, it's that good.Finally, if you are a fan of Mexican beers, La Fondita makes a very tasty Michelada with your choice of beer and even carry a fine selection of tequilas such as Don Julio Añejo (my favorite).

The chicken is very dry and the sauce just plain weird. My husband, who rarely ever complains, says his burrito is terrible; full of lettuce and the El pastor has no flavor, tortilla is chewy. Chips were stale and the bean dip barely warm and tasteless. So yep strike 3! I am not sure what the people on here that gave such great reviews were getting. Our bill was $20 for terrible bland semi-cold food. The menu was not the same as pictured here online. The food we received did not look anything like what we see in these pics, nor were some of the items available that are pictured here. I am not sure if its new owners or what.

The first thing I'll tell you is that when they bring the pre-meal chips, they not only bring fresh made salsa, but they bring you a small plate of their refried beans with some queso fresco sprinkled on top. It's a nice touch and the refried beans are really, really good. They are very lightly seasoned, unlike so many where the beans become a salt lick.Ok, so the place is out of the way on Center, about halfway between the State Hospital and Lancaster Mall. If you don't know it's there, you will never find it. It's immediately West of the convenience store and share the building with another business. inside is clean and bright, but not hoity-toity. Think neat and clean, but pretty spartan. There are a couple of TVs and unsurprisingly, soccer was playing. To me, that's always a good sign, btw. When I go to little hole-in-the-wall places and see cultural things not just displayed but lived, I feel much more at home. Be aware that the whole place is half of a small building, so I *think* they had 10 tables, but that might be an over-estimate.After seeing mole negro on the menu, I was set to try it, but they were out. :( The waitress suggested the mole verde instead. I mentioned that I sometimes write reviews and an amuse bouche appeared. I can only call it that because it wasn't on the menu that I could find and it didn't seem like anyone else got it. I'm not a big pork person, but these short ribs were delightful and the sauce was really, really good. it was a balanced sauce that appeared to have tomatillos and chiles, but also other ingredients I didn't figure out. Let's just say that I kinda wish I'd gotten THAT dish.So, the mole verde was surprisingly bland. It came with two pieces of chicken (thigh and leg) that were well-braised in the mole verde. I'd love to tell you that I thought this was a spectacular dish, but like I said, it was a little bland.The tortillas that came with the meal were outstanding and freshly made in back, not sourced from plastic. The rice and beans that accompanied the meal were outstanding and I had a great time making little tacos of the chicken, accompaniments, and sauce.The margaritas were strong and good, but I'm pretty sure they use a mix instead of making the margaritas with the magic ratio (2:1:1:1), but it was over 90 degrees, so ANY cold beverage was welcome.I'm giving 4 stars because of the short-rib dish and the beans. I'm looking forward to my next trip down and trying more things (like the mole negro). If something sublime appears again (or something tragic happens), I'll update my review and rating, but for now, I'm happy to have found a little, hole-in-the-wall Mexican place in Salem, which is a desert for decent dining out.",,Yes,No,Yes,,No

I had said I would lunch, but never dinner again, and yet I ended up here two more times for an evening meal. Both were unexceptional and made me not want to return (for dinner). In short, the food quality is not great and prices are spendy for said quality. It is (nice? weird?) that they have severe options on the menu for pricing. E.g. for main meals there's curry for $12, beef for $22, or salmon for $32 ( or something along those lines). Differentials are pretty extreme. Better watch what your date prefers ; - )At our table...The side ""roasted brussels sprouts"" were not roasted at all. They were cooked-in-water brussels without any salt or oil, and they were nearly raw. This restaurant clearly does not understand the term ""roasted""; the brussels were obviously either boiled or steamed and then some or all of them were flash broiled/baked for a minute or two. Terrible. (I mean, personally, I love steamed brussels. Had that been advertised on the menu, my only complaint would have been that the brussels needed to be cooked and salted more; the ones on my table were nearly raw and utterly lacked seasoning.) The fact that 508 advertised them as ""roasted"" rather than ""boiled"" or ""steamed"" is really irritating to me because it's obviously inaccurate if not a blatant lie.The steak was supposed to come out ""medium rare"" but it came out medium-well and without any enhanced or additional qualities whatsoever. The side ""slaw"" was also tasteless and dry. The cabbage was clearly cut hours or perhaps days ago. No salt or seasonings, again.

When we finally got our food, very disappointed in the Mac and Cheese. Boiled, no broiling or baking. Not much better than Mom's stovetop Kraft.  See photo. Salmon with puréed cauliflower much akin to baby food. Salmon didn't make much of a statement but it was okay.  The fiddlehead ferns are a delightful novelty but would be better if well drained and served hot.   Desserts were nice (we recommend the pineapple ).

But they were okay with the food.The bad. My food was cold. Not just cool. Not just room temperature....the butternut squash was flat out cold. To the point that I asked the server if it was supposed to be that way. They assured me that it wasn't and took it back to replace the mash. They returned the chop and slaw. However, it took so long for the mash to be remade that my chop, which was barely room temperature to begin with, was super cold by the time I got it back.  I hadn't wanted to eat it before getting the replacement, because eating a plate of plain butternut squash mash didn't sound so great. But the alternative of eating hot butternut mash with cold pork chop wasn't so great either....I must say however, even if the earl had been served at a reasonable temperature, I don't think it would have been that great. It was so sweet!  There was no real variation of flavor. It was a sweet sauce covering the chop, with a sweet slaw and a sweet mash. It really needed something spicy or savory....more acid in the slaw...something to break up all the sweet!!I may go back, but if I do....I'm sticking to the eggs!",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Free

It was busy (they said a 30-45 minute wait) and put our name on the wait list and asked to be called when a table opened up. We got a call not more than 15 minutes later that our table was ready. Got seated and offered a choice of still or sparking water and then checked out the menu. All of the food sounded good from the headings, but the descriptions didn't offer much more insight into what to expect. We started with the crab toasters which were good, but not exceptional. The crab was stringy and got caught in my teeth and annoyed me for the rest of the evening. For entrees we ordered the rootbeer pork chop and the duck breast. The duck was cooked perfectly (crispy skin, nicely rendered fat) and the blueberries were great too. The broccolini could have used a little more seasoning. We ordered a glass of red wine with the duck that the waiter recommended but it didn't pair very well. The pork chop was a little pinker than I would have liked, but it was seasoned well. The butternut squash it came with was coconutty and delicious. The ""apple"" slaw was good too but mainly made up of carrot with a few pieces of apple. Also the menu mentioned a rootbeer reduction which made me think there would be a sauce with it, which there was not. The dish would have been even better if there had been a little sauce. Overall everything was flavorful and cooked pretty well. The service was fairly friendly, a little on the slower side, and forgot minor things (like brining appetizer plates when serving our app).

I called a week in advance to make a reservation for 18 people. I spoke with a girl named Cassie who told me for a group that size I would have to reserve the wine room at one thousand dollars to hold it. She also said that they would have to create a special menu for us so that it wouldn't be too hard on the chefs. She went on to say that they have a 20% gratuity that they add on when larger crowds. When I heard this I said ""Oh never mind, I don't want this to be a stuffy experience for us, I'll just choose another restaurant"". I asked if they had gluten free options as two of my diners have gluten allergies. She said yes, they have a handful of gluten free options. I said well I have already handed out sample menus for dinner happy hour ect. so to have a limited menu gives us a limited experience. She said wait a moment, she came back and told me that she is required to say that, but that they could waive that gratuity amount but could get in trouble if she didn't give me the rules about the thousand dollar deposit, gratuity ect. I said well, we all don't even have to sit together but I just want to make sure there are 18 spots open. If 18 people walked into your restaurant on a Friday night you wouldn't have to shorten your menu for the chefs to accommodate them would you? She said no. I said okay well put us down for 18 and I will call you the day before with an accurate head count. I called her the day before and the head count was 14. We arrived at 5:20 and they set us up in two tables. One sat 6 and the other was 8. They did not honor the happy hour menu. They said in order to take advantage of those prices you had to sit in the lounge. One of the girls in our group asked the waitress if we could still order happy hour drinks since their lounge was too small to accommodate us and that we'd lose our table if we all moved. The waitress said she'd go ask. She came back and said No. We said okay and I immediately felt bad because I'm the one who chose this restaurant. Each Plate was 18-35 dollars. Now had it been a great experience and the food matched the prices then it would be worth it. It wasn't. I ordered the warm crock of olives with anchovies chili and oil. They had four anchovies laying in the oil, not cooked down with a tiny crock it should have been 1/2 an anchovy. It was really salty. Two people at the table ordered the rosemary French fries. Those were VERY good. They came with homemade ketchup. The ketchup however had cayenne pepper. The girl who ordered them does not like spicy food at all (that was my reason for picking a restaurant with American fare).  I enjoyed the spicy ketchup. Two at our table ordered the pork belly lettuce wrap. The look on his face when he seen two pieces of lettuce and a burnt piece of fatty bacon on top was bad. His wife ordered a side of asparagus and they had the fries. She had the crab toasties. It was two small baguette slices with crab spread for 9.00. They were NOT happy. Three of us ordered the beer reduction pork chop and butternut squash. The pork chop was the best cooked pork chop I have ever had. It was juicy and soft, just perfect....now to the bad part. Nowhere in that menu does it mention that the root beer reduction has cayenne pepper all in the sauce that is all over the pork chop and underneath the butternut squash. This food was spicy! It was a medium in the heat department. My friend that did not eat the ketchup due to the cayenne ordered this dish. Now mind you I like spicy food and it was making my mouth and lips burn a bit but it was still pretty good. She ate it. I told her to please send it back and ask them to make your root beer reduction sauce without cayenne. Any time an item is spicy it should ALWAYS be notated. She sat there and ate it. I felt bad. The girl across that ordered the pork chop said it was pretty good but dang hot. At the end of the meal we got our checks and each one had the 20% gratuity included. Remember Cassie told me that would not happen. We were a group of six at our table. As we all walked out each person said they were not happy with the food or service for the price. One lady said she ordered the lettuce wraps and was extremely disappointed. She also told me that the fella across from her ordered the salmon and said the color is kind of funny. He's a 20 year old kid so the lady across from him said Oh that fish is not all the way cooked. Please ask them to fire it again for a bit more. He said ""I'm so hungry I'll just eat it"". The lady asked the waitress for him and once it was heated up and cooked through he said it was super. I am very disappointed. My gluten free friend and daughter had the crock of olives and a side of potato salad. They hung out and then got up to say goodbye, said they were on their way to eat sushi. I guess the gluten free options were limited to sides and appetizers? I won't choose the next place.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Free

We were here last night, Friday. We sat at the bar. Rob (the main man bartender) is a hoot.  He's busy every minute making cocktails with fresh fruit and herbs. He made time to chat us up with good humor and -plenty of knowledge about wine, spirits, food and the area.  My wife and I had a late supper.  We shared the garden salad.  The greens & vegetables were fresh & delicious with a spicy sesame dressing.  The dressing definitely had a kick.  They make a fresh salad dressing weekly.Then we shared the seared ribeye with roasted parmesan potatoes. The ribeye comes with a garlic rosemary butter.  I'm not a fan of rosemary and they were happy to do an herbed butter with no rosemary.  The meat was high quality and perfectly cooked.  The potatoes were a fabulous pairing with  steak.  The potatoes were crispy on the outside with a soft buttery inside.  My wife is trying to figure out how to make those ""taters at home"".  We had a bottle of Willamette Valley Pinot noir which was perfect with our food.  We had the dark chocolate cake for desert.  It was moist, fresh & perfect with the red wine we had left to finish.  Rob recommended the upside down banana cake but we went for the chocolate!So, that was last night and we came back tonight (Saturday) because we had such a great experience.  Again we sat at the bar and Rob and the staff were busy making everything perfect. Tonight my wife had ""Red and Fuzzy"" cocktail.  It's vodka, elderflower, grapefruit & cranberry.  It was fresh squeezed juice & my sweetheart was licking her lips while drinking that concoction.  Tonight we tried the crock of warm olives with crusty bread. It was great with our cocktails.  The olives were warm & delicious. That would be a great appetizer for a larger party.  A couple bites is just enough. We had the ribeye with roasted potatoes & chocolate cake again. We probably should have tried something different but it was so yummy last night. All the food that other guests were getting looked great.  The environment is hip & inviting. The service is great & food is fabulous.

We were visiting some family in Salem and were recommended to try this restaurant. Who would have thought that Salem had such a gem. This place was amazing in terms of service, dining choices, and quality for the price.The staff were on point from the get go. Even though my SO and I were definitely on the younger spectrum of patrons, we were greeted with respect and timeliness (something we sometimes don't get based on our age and attire elsewhere). Our server, Charles, was attentive and our water was filled without us ever having to ask. Here's my food breakdown:Appetizer: -The mushrooms were delicious and rich.-The complimentary dinner rolls went well with the rosemary garlic butter. If you're feeling like more carbs, I recommend dipping another roll in the mushroom sauce.-GET THE CRAB-CAKES. If you like crab, or if you're like me and thinks crab is sometimes overrated, I kid you not, these crab cakes are bomb. These are better than many of the Maryland style crab cakes I had in DC and Maryland. You can taste the freshness of the crabs and the creamy sauce it was served with worked well.Main course: I got the 8 oz filet mignon, with sides of asparagus, Caesar salad, and mashed potatoes. We wanted to see the difference between their two filets, so the SO got the house special filet mignon, with asparagus, Caesar salad and baked potato. We also got a taster of the Tomahawk steak.-My filet was delicious and melted in your mouth. You can really taste the NW quality of the steak. My fiancé really liked mine.-The SO's filet was just as good (I thought his was better than mine) and came with a  Béarnaise sauce. Although I did enjoy the sauce, that steak was so perfectly done that it could have stood alone.-The asparagus was very crisp. My SO preferred a more roasted asparagus but I liked how the freshness contrasted the richness of the steak and potatoes.-I liked the Caesar salad because you can definitely taste the anchovies in the dressing. My only thing is I wished I asked for dressing on the side because they were generous with the dressing whereas I prefer less.-I really liked the mashed potatoes and even the SO, who doesn't like mash potatoes, really liked it! Like it was perfect amount of cream, butter and chunky-smooth ratio.-The tomahawk steak was so flavorful. Compared to the ones I've tried in Mastro's and a few other steakhouses in LA, it was just as good if not better. I think the yummy smokey flavor was attributed to the seasoning they use. Alcohol:-They are extremely well stocked in terms of wine. If you're really wanting to impress someone, you can try their high end wines. Whoever stocks their wine definitely did their homework to get that wide of a range in terms of the price spectrum and origin. Our server was super helpful in helping us the wine that fitted our hearty meal.-I was told that they're working on their whiskey selection so the next time we visit Salem, we will definitely explore that.Dessert -The blueberry bread pudding with bourbon sauce was so decadent. It was moist and firm, which I prefer over the softer bread puddings.-The SO got the cheesecake with Marionberry reduction. I'm not a huge cheesecake fan but it was pretty good. I think the vanilla wafer crust was a nice, lighter touch.Pros:1. Big food and wine selection.2. Ambiance was nice. I loved how the patio was super romantic and the indoors was well lit. Beautiful chandeliers and nice jazz instrumentals in the background.3. Great service. I never felt pressured to leave and we were there for a good 2.5 hours. The place was always filled so I'm going to recommend a reservation.Cons1. Parking was confusing as a visitor. We parked in a spot that said no parking after 9 pm but the rest of the street had free parking after 9. So, just double check before you park. 2. The bathroom situation was a bit confusing too because it was down this long hall.3. We were told that there was some remodeling going on that was going to be done next week. (Honestly I didn't even notice but the SO pointed out a wall.) Overall, I felt like this place was up to par with some of the big steak houses in LA (sorry, haven't really tried too many steak houses in other big cities). Compared to their Portland counterparts, their prices were great considering the grade of steak they served. I really don't think I'm ever going to find that good of a filet mignon for under $40 in LA.  Sorry for the rambling. I'm just really impressed with Salem and this place.",,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Free

For their birthday celebration you could do a sampler plate with a 2 ounce cut of all 9 steaks and the pork chop.  Also had an additional option for adding 4 rare Cabernet Sauvignon samples. I have never had the opportunity to try so many exquisite cuts of meat side by side and really be able to compare and contrast the different textures, flavors, and nuances of each one.  This had to be a logistical nightmare for the kitchen and it did take a bit longer to get the meals served, but it was 100% worth it.  Started off with the Caesar salad and it was amazing, made in house and you can actually taste all of the anchovies that are typically missing from lesser commercially available Caesar dressing.  The steaks samples were all amazing.

I completed the main course but had to try a salad that i saw on the menu and ordered a ""half-order"" Cobb which was quite large.  All the components were very fresh and the bacon was done crispy but not burnt, just the way i like it.  The eggs were also done perfectly - no rubber eggs here.  As much as I wanted to try their deserts, i'll wait until I can bring my wife next time to experience that with her.  I highly recommend this for a nice quiet lunch (there was only one other couple on my side of the restaurant when I went).

Rudy's was exactly what we were looking for. And in truth, the Marionberry cobbler on their dessert menu made the decision for us.I called in at like 5 to get a reservation and they were able to get our party of 8 in at about 7:45 (which isn't terrible if they are regularly quite busy). Good to okay service (I asked for someone to help me with a wine selection and no one ever showed up). Menu covered a lot of ground but did not cover a wide price range -- very few moderate priced choices. For example, my teenager doesn't need to spend $30 on any dish, but he's too big for the children's menu (it's great that they have a kid's menu, BTW), so a few more in-between options would help. All of the food was delicious. As it should be.OK wine list -- would benefit from more single glass options, particularly local. I wanted Willamette Valley options and there were just a few.

Frankly, the quality of the food was mixed at best. Soup was good. Salad was unremarkable and my crab cakes and side dish was burnt. The sauce, which had been mentioned in other reviews, was lumpy and lacked flavor. My 85 year old mom paid the ticket and I believe we were overcharged. Can not be sure because she did not see or keep the customer copy of the bill. This meal was not up to standard and overpriced.

Our friend had the sirloin burger and said it was the best burger she'd had.Our service was so, so. It seemed as if there was one actual waitress with other staff filling in where they could. My drink, a simple Captain & Coke, took approximately 20 minutes to arrive. Which leads me to my next point, the bar.The Captain & Coke that I had and the Bloody Mary that my date had were both overwhelmed by the amount of alcohol contained in them.

So far Rudy's seems to hold its own with any of those restaurants. Case in point is the Lamb Chops which I ordered.  I also ordered Lamb at Coquine which was good but I have to give Rudy's the edge mainly because it seemed that Rudy's cooked it like a steak which was good. So that is saying something.  I think I would give Rudy's Lamb chops a 4.5.In the past I've had their prime rib which was good not great.
